2025-01-05 04:23:45+00:00,Agri,"the fundamental driver of economic systems isn't money – it's scarcity. scarcity evolved through human history and economic thought. in ancient civilizations, the scarcity of food, land, or water was a constant concern, driving trade, agriculture, and even warfare. in every economy, some resources are less scarce, while others are highly limited. in today’s world, one of the scarcest commodities is attention. while not a physical commodity, attention in the digital age has been described as a scarce commodity due to the overwhelming amount of content vying for consumer engagement. we're facing an unprecedented scarcity crisis in human attention spans, which have dropped from 12 seconds in 2000 to a mere 8.25 seconds in 2023. that's worse than a goldfish. not a joke. if your brain were a computer (it's actually way more complex), you'd have roughly 2.5 petabytes of storage. but your conscious processing power is only about 120 bits per second. this creates a brutal bottleneck. the ancient humans worried about food scarcity – we're dealing with attention scarcity. to get this scarce commodity, you typically trade something valuable or use what you have to acquire it. the most straightforward method is to buy the commodity if you can afford the market price, which tends to be high due to scarcity. for very rare items, which in this case is 'attention', auctions might be your best bet. there might be disparities in how attention is distributed, with certain platforms or creators monopolizing attention, leading to calls for fairer distribution mechanisms or platforms. this has spawned a $343b attention economy. google and meta captured 46.4% of global digital ad revenue in 2023 – essentially becoming attention monarchs. they're not just companies; they're attention refineries, processing raw human consciousness into monetizable units. new models of monetizing attention that respect user time and privacy could emerge, potentially involving direct payments for attention or more equitable ad-sharing systems. our current systems for monetizing attention are outdated—like trying to stream netflix on a dial-up connection. the metrics are wrong. cpm (cost per mille) and ctr (click through rate) are industrial-age tools trying to measure quantum-level human cognition. we need a radical redesign. imagine: neural-value tokens: direct micropayments for sustained attention, verified through biometric engagement. attention mining protocols: like bitcoin, but you're mining-focused human consciousness distributed attention networks: breaking up attention monopolies through decentralized engagement systems the real next-gen social media platform won't be about likes or shares. it'll be about creating sustainable attention economics – what i wanted to call ""attention allocation optimization."" humanity’s total attention budget is ~55 quadrillion bits/day (8b people × 16 waking hours × 120 bits/second). out of the ~2.5 hours average daily social media time per person, only 7% represents genuine, focused engagement. we're running at 93% neural waste. not sustainable. we're bankrupting it on cat videos and outrage algorithms. the solution isn't just better algorithms – it's a fundamental economic redesign. we need attention ubi (universal basic income), carbon credits for attention, and neural engagement futures markets. treat attention like energy. energy needs sustainable management. current attention economics is the equivalent of burning coal in a steam engine – primitive and wasteful. the future will be powered by sustainable attention. the rest is noise. economic systems run on scarcity, not money.",0.027324113994836807,0.48616161942481995,0.48651424050331116,-0.45883750542998314

2025-01-25 07:56:48+00:00,Agri,"good morning everyone! mastering bearish patterns: trade like a pro bearish patterns are critical tools for traders aiming to anticipate potential downward price movements in financial markets. here's a complete explanation of some key bearish patterns: 1. descending triangle definition: the descending triangle is a bearish continuation pattern that forms when the price makes lower highs while maintaining a horizontal support level. this indicates that sellers are gaining strength, and buyers are struggling to maintain the price. key features: lower highs form a descending trendline. a flat support line at the bottom. typically breaks downward when support is breached. how to trade: enter a short trade when the price breaks below the horizontal support with significant volume. place a stop-loss above the most recent lower high. target the height of the triangle projected downward from the breakout point. 2. head & shoulders pattern definition: this classic reversal pattern signals a shift from an uptrend to a downtrend. it consists of three peaks: a higher central peak (head) flanked by two lower peaks (shoulders) and a neckline acting as support. key features: left shoulder, head, and right shoulder. neckline connects the lows of the shoulders and head. a break below the neckline confirms the pattern. how to trade: enter a short trade when the price breaks below the neckline. place a stop-loss above the right shoulder. measure the height from the head to the neckline and project it downward for the profit target. 3. bearish flag pattern definition: the bearish flag is a continuation pattern that occurs after a strong downward move. the ""flag"" represents a period of consolidation, and the breakout typically continues in the direction of the prior trend. key features: a steep downward move (flagpole). a parallel, upward-sloping consolidation channel (flag). breaks downward from the flag. how to trade: enter a short trade when the price breaks below the flag’s lower boundary. place a stop-loss above the flag’s upper boundary. target the length of the flagpole projected downward. 4. symmetrical triangle definition: a symmetrical triangle forms when the price consolidates with lower highs and higher lows, creating a triangle shape. though this pattern can break in either direction, it often signals a continuation of the prior trend, making it bearish in a downtrend. key features: converging trendlines. price oscillates within the triangle. breaks in the direction of the prevailing trend. how to trade: enter a short trade when the price breaks below the lower trendline. place a stop-loss above the upper trendline. target the height of the triangle projected downward. 5. double top pattern definition: the double top is a bearish reversal pattern that forms after an uptrend. it features two peaks at roughly the same level, separated by a trough. key features: two similar highs. a neckline at the trough level. a break below the neckline confirms the pattern. how to trade: enter a short trade when the price breaks below the neckline. place a stop-loss above the second peak. measure the height between the peaks and the neckline and project it downward for the target. 6. up channel pattern definition: an up channel, also known as a rising channel, is a bearish reversal pattern when it forms in a larger downtrend. the price moves within two upward-sloping parallel trendlines before breaking downward. key features: parallel upward trendlines. lower lows and higher highs within the channel. breaks below the lower trendline. how to trade: enter a short trade when the price breaks below the lower boundary of the channel. place a stop-loss above the upper boundary. target the height of the channel projected downward. 7. triple top pattern definition: this bearish reversal pattern forms after an uptrend and consists of three peaks at roughly the same level, indicating that buyers are unable to push the price higher. key features: three similar highs. a neckline at the lowest trough between the peaks. breaks below the neckline to confirm. how to trade: enter a short trade when the price breaks below the neckline. place a stop-loss above the highest peak. measure the height from the peaks to the neckline and project it downward for the target. 8. bearish rectangle pattern definition: a bearish rectangle is a continuation pattern where the price consolidates between two horizontal levels before breaking downward. key features: horizontal support and resistance lines. price oscillates within the rectangle. breaks below the support line. how to trade: enter a short trade when the price breaks below the support line with volume. place a stop-loss above the resistance line. target the height of the rectangle projected downward. 9. inverted cup & handle pattern definition: this bearish reversal pattern resembles an upside-down cup with a handle. the ""cup"" forms a rounded top, and the ""handle"" represents a consolidation phase before the breakdown. key features: rounded top (cup). slight upward-sloping consolidation (handle). breaks downward from the handle. how to trade: enter a short trade when the price breaks below the handle’s lower boundary. place a stop-loss above the handle. measure the height of the cup and project it downward for the target. by mastering these bearish patterns, traders can anticipate price movements and execute informed trades with confidence. practice identifying these patterns on charts and combine them with other technical tools for optimal results. stay healthy, everything is temporary.!",0.029919685795903206,0.13958163559436798,0.8304986953735352,-0.10966194979846478

policies—fragmented regulations, trade barriers, and lack of innovation—that are holding us back the most."" the trump administration’s recent decision to impose a 25% tariff on canadian and mexican food products is a wake-up call for canada’s agri-food sector. as a nation that prides itself on food security and a robust agricultural trade surplus, canada now faces a critical test of its ability to remain competitive in an increasingly protectionist global economy. according to the new global agri-food most influential nations ranking, compiled by the agri-food analytics lab at dalhousie university and commissioned by mnp, canada ranks thirteenth among g20 nations in terms of global agri-food influence. the united states, our neighbours, are number one. while the country has high performance in food security and political stability, its weaknesses lie in innovation, trade diversification, regulatory efficiency, and interprovincial trade barriers. these vulnerabilities are now being exploited by the latest u.s. trade policy shift. canada’s agri-food trade surplus stands at $13.3 billion, ranking fifth among g20 nations. this surplus underscores canada’s role as a net food exporter, supplying high-quality agricultural products to global markets, with the u.s. being the most significant trading partner. a 25% tariff on canadian food exports will inevitably disrupt this balance, making canadian goods less competitive in the u.s. market, leading to lower profit margins for producers, and ultimately affecting canadian consumers. the tariffs will also exacerbate existing challenges within the industry. the dalhousie report highlights canada’s struggle with high logistical costs due to its vast geography, regulatory obstacles for small businesses, and the lack of strategic investments in value-added processing. compounding these issues are interprovincial trade barriers, which prevent efficient movement of food products within canada itself. these barriers, ranging from differing provincial regulations to taxation inconsistencies, increase costs for producers and limit economic growth. with american tariffs cutting deep into exports, the need for canada to build stronger trade alliances beyond the u.s. has never been more urgent. canada is currently classified as a tier 2 country in global agri-food competitiveness, trailing behind tier 1 leaders like the u.s., japan, china, and germany. these nations have successfully implemented policies that encourage innovation, facilitate exports, and support domestic industries through targeted investments. canada’s fragmented regulatory framework, interprovincial trade restrictions, and inconsistent support for agri-food innovation leave it vulnerable in times of economic turbulence. the report emphasizes the importance of domestic processing investments, which would allow canada to capture more value from its agricultural output rather than simply exporting raw materials. this is a key area where canada lags behind top-performing nations. with the u.s. tariffs threatening canada’s access to its largest market, the government must act decisively to enhance domestic food processing capabilities and expand export markets in asia, europe, and the middle east. the tariffs imposed by the trump administration serve as a stark reminder that canada cannot afford to rely too heavily on any single trade partner. diversifying trade relationships and strengthening domestic food production and processing are now imperatives, not just aspirations. policy actions must include: increased r&d investment – canada must prioritize research in agri-food innovation, including advanced food processing, precision agriculture, and sustainable farming practices. regulatory reform – a streamlined, transparent regulatory environment would enable agri-food startups and small businesses to scale up and compete internationally. trade diversification – expanding trade agreements beyond north america to markets like the european union, japan, and southeast asia would mitigate the risks of protectionist policies from the u.s. domestic processing growth – more investment in food processing facilities would help retain economic value within canada, reducing reliance on raw commodity exports. strategic infrastructure development – addressing high transportation costs and supply chain inefficiencies would enhance canada’s competitiveness in global food markets. interprovincial trade reform – removing barriers that limit the free movement of food products between provinces would improve domestic market efficiency and competitiveness. canada’s agri-food sector is at a crossroads. the trump administration’s tariffs have exposed underlying weaknesses in canada’s trade strategy and industry resilience. while canada enjoys food security and a stable political environment, its ability to innovate and expand its global influence remains constrained by structural inefficiencies. by implementing forward-looking policies, canada can turn this challenge into an opportunity—one that strengthens its agri-food industry and secures its place as a global leader in food production and export. if canada fails to act swiftly, the consequences will extend far beyond the farm gate. the time to secure canada’s agri-food future is now.",0.032935574650764465,0.9122481346130371,0.05481627210974693,-0.8793125599622726

2025-02-22 15:48:05+00:00,Agri,"canada’s internal trade fix? anand’s plan leaves major barriers untouched “supply management is the linchpin of canada’s internal trade dysfunction, keeping food prices high and stifling competition. while ottawa celebrates minor progress in removing trade barriers, the real roadblock remains untouched—an outdated system that prioritizes protectionism over affordability and efficiency.” minister , the outgoing liberal minister, recently announced that over 60% of canada’s internal trade barriers will soon be eliminated. ottawa claims to have removed 64% of federal exceptions in the canadian free trade agreement (cfta), though it has yet to release a list of the 20 newly removed exceptions—expected next week. while this is a commendable step, it falls short, particularly in the food sector, where inefficiencies persist due to longstanding protectionist policies. while much attention has been given to interprovincial restrictions on alcoholic products—an issue rooted in canada’s regulatory history—barriers in the broader food sector remain just as problematic. nova scotia and british columbia boast the highest number of vineyards per capita in the country, yet both provinces struggle to sell their world-class products to canadians in other regions. this inefficiency is emblematic of canada’s broader internal trade dysfunction. multiple studies, including reports from the , the , and the , estimate that eliminating interprovincial trade barriers could save canadians up to $9 billion annually on food alone—excluding potential savings in the restaurant sector. for the average canadian, this could translate into more than $250 in yearly savings. however, most of these savings’ hinge on reforming supply management, a policy that remains politically untouchable for the current government. anand’s continued shielding of supply management in dairy is problematic. eggs and poultry also operate under supply management, but these sectors have demonstrated a long-standing tradition of coordinated governance and strategic collaboration among provincial marketing boards, ensuring stability and efficiency across the supply chain. that is not the case in dairy. supply management functions as a quota system that limits imports through tariffs exceeding 200% on certain products from countries like the united states. this system, while benefiting a concentrated group of producers, drives up domestic prices, creating artificial inefficiencies in canada’s food economy. quebec remains the epicenter of protectionism, benefiting disproportionately from these internal trade barriers. despite housing just 20% of canada’s population, quebec produces nearly 40% of the nation’s milk. the provincial control over quota allocation ensures that quebec’s dairy industry operates in a closed system, effectively blocking competition from other provinces and maintaining inflated prices. a truly free and competitive dairy market in canada would require federal harmonization of quota allocations and the elimination of provincial dairy boards. this would allow all provinces an equal opportunity to produce milk and butterfat competitively, rather than permitting smaller, less efficient quebec farms to dictate national pricing structures. removing these artificial constraints would introduce greater efficiency into the sector, benefiting consumers and non-quebec producers alike. yet, political considerations have consistently obstructed any meaningful reform. quebec premier ’s insistence that supply management is “not negotiable,” as stated in washington, underscores the entrenched nature of these policies. however, his stance is increasingly untenable in the face of mounting economic evidence that these trade barriers impose significant costs on consumers and hinder national competitiveness. beyond dairy, regulatory fragmentation across provinces stifles food manufacturing. if a food product is deemed safe for sale in nova scotia, it should logically be permitted for sale in alberta, ontario, or quebec. yet, under the current system, manufacturers and processors with only provincial licenses can sell exclusively within their province. even federally licensed facilities must navigate redundant bureaucratic hurdles to access domestic markets. enforcing mutual recognition of food safety standards across provinces would significantly reduce these inefficiencies, allowing beef and pork processors, seafood producers, and other food manufacturers to expand their markets without costly regulatory duplication. such reforms would be transformative, particularly for the economies of atlantic canada and the prairies, regions that would benefit from improved market access. increased competition would lower costs for consumers, strengthen regional food industries, and foster a more dynamic national economy. yet, resistance from entrenched interests continues to stifle progress. minister anand’s announcement is a step forward, but it does not address the fundamental inefficiencies that continue to plague canada’s food economy. the cfta was designed to facilitate internal trade, yet its multiple exemptions continue to allow provinces to uphold protectionist policies at the expense of consumers and businesses. the federal government has long championed international free trade agreements but has failed to secure genuine free trade within its own borders. while anand’s announcement represents incremental progress, it is far from sufficient. until canada takes decisive action to eliminate all interprovincial trade barriers—including those protecting supply management—consumers, businesses, and entire regions will continue to bear the burden of political inaction.",0.16838273406028748,0.46632879972457886,0.36528849601745605,-0.2979460656642914

""interprovincial trade barriers have quietly strangled economic growth for decades—nova scotia just proved that breaking them down is not only possible but necessary for a stronger, more competitive canada."" the federal government can talk endlessly about eliminating interprovincial trade barriers, but ultimately, it is up to the provinces to take real action. canada now has a clear front-runner in this effort: nova scotia. premier and his government have recognized the steep cost that interprovincial trade barriers have imposed on their province and the atlantic region. being geographically distant from major markets has already put nova scotia at a disadvantage, making it difficult to compete against larger provinces unless a sector has developed a unique competitive edge—such as the province’s thriving wine industry. however, with trade barriers limiting access to larger provincial markets, growth in the food sector has been stifled. now, nova scotia is raising the stakes. bill 36, the free trade and mobility within canada act, is a significant step forward in eliminating these internal trade obstacles. the legislation ensures that goods manufactured or produced in another province or territory that comply with that jurisdiction's regulatory standards will not be subjected to additional fees or testing by nova scotia. premier houston put it succinctly: “if it’s good enough for another province, it’ll be good enough for nova scotia because i trust other provinces and territories to have appropriate requirements that keep their citizens safe.” but this commitment to trade liberalization must be a two-way street. other provinces—and the federal government—need to follow suit. it’s called mutual recognition, and it should become the standard nationwide. for the food industry, this means that any provincially licensed facility across the country can provide ingredients and products to nova scotia’s food manufacturers, restaurants, and retailers—so long as their home province reciprocates and accepts nova scotia-made products. this shift would enhance consumer choice, drive competition, and create opportunities for small businesses. the result? lower prices, more innovation, and stronger regional economies. the economic toll of protectionism for too long, interprovincial trade barriers have prioritized protectionism over value, quality, innovation, and economic growth. these barriers were largely invisible but economically devastating, preventing smaller provinces like nova scotia from reaching their full potential. in theory, canadian provinces should have the easiest trade relationships in the world—no border brokerage, no international regulatory alignments—yet internal barriers have choked opportunities for decades. if mutual recognition were to expand across the country, many provinces stand to gain significantly, particularly alberta, saskatchewan, and atlantic canada. removing unnecessary regulatory duplication will stimulate investment and growth in key sectors, including agri-food. overcoming resistance of course, passing legislation like bill 36 is the easy part. the real challenge lies in overcoming opposition from special interest groups, unions, and industry lobbies that resist competition and mutual reciprocity. these groups have long benefited from protectionist measures that shield them from outside competitors. a truly open internal market would mean fewer government-mandated inefficiencies and could threaten some entrenched provincial interests. a common argument against mutual recognition is that it could erode provincial identity—particularly when it comes to food. but identity and culture do not emerge from regulation; they thrive on innovation and passion. the belief that strict provincial regulations are necessary to preserve distinctiveness is misguided. true uniqueness in food and agriculture is not built through bureaucratic red tape—it is built through ingenuity and consumer trust. what’s next? nova scotia has set the bar high. other provinces should take note: economic protectionism is outdated, and interprovincial trade reform is long overdue. now, , perhaps it's time for a conversation about another major trade barrier within canada—our overpowering provincial marketing boards, particularly in the dairy sector. dr. sylvain charlebois is the director of the agri-food analytics lab at dalhousie university and co-host of the food professor podcast.",0.19790805876255035,0.04486231133341789,0.7572296261787415,0.15304574742913246

2025-03-03 20:51:09+00:00,Agri,"a few years after completing his university studies in chennai, india, mr. ezhilarasan headed to tamil nadu to find his fortune in the construction materials trade. a decade later, he has another mission: hitting it big with farming in ghana. mr. ezhilarasan believes that the north of ghana is a massive bread basket with huge untapped opportunities. he has secured large land concessions to grow grains. now, he wants to make ghana self-sufficient in wheat. he has thus teamed up with a bunch of smart ghanaian scientists at csi-csir to come up with wheat varieties that will grow well in the country's soils and climate. ghana is on course to import about 900,000 tons of wheat this year at a cost of about $230 million. the question he and the scientists are asking is: why the hell not grow all that wheat in ghana and pocket the bucks? i doubt they intended that effect, but mr. ezhilarasan and the scientists have opened the door for a discussion of elementary trade economics and national production policy. should ghana prioritise growing its own wheat? wheat is interesting in ghana because the country has built the capacity to add value to a lot of it. very different from, say, rice and tomatoes, which are imported primarily for consumption. wheat imports, by contrast, are mainly for production inputs in takoradi and tema. just like japan or the netherlands would import a lot of cocoa from ghana to turn into chocolate, ghana imports wheat from canada, argentina, the us, and others, mainly to mill into wheat flour. wheat flour is the base ingredient for bread and other bakeries, which are almost staple foods in ghana. if japan and the netherlands don't bother to grow cocoa, should ghana grow wheat? let's look at a few numbers. ghana has four wheat flour factories with a capacity to produce 800,000 tons of wheat flour a year. if they were running at full capacity, 1.05 million tons of wheat would be needed. instead, they currently consume about 680,000 tons of imported wheat to produce about 500,000 tons of wheat flour, and some leftover bran and feed mill. the likes of takoradi flour mills, for instance, will sell a ton of their wheat flour for about $740. if we use this as a trading benchmark, then from the 680,000 tons of imported wheat (~$160m), ghanaian factories create value of about $400m. a rough rule of thumb is that from 1 ton of wheat flour, you can make about 1,300 loafs of standard-sized bread that costs about $1.3 each. of course, other ingredients are involved (as is the case when considering cocoa to chocolate as well). still, it is interesting to see that about $1.7m in value is generated from about $170m of wheat imports. it bears noting, as i have said already, that the factories are operating at just above 60% average capacity. and that ghana imports wheat flour to the tune of about $37 million (roughly 140,000 tons) so there is still room for ghanaian flour manufacturers to grow. most importantly of all, ghanaian flour manufacturers are yet to even tap into the export market. should the priority be to get wheat as cheaply as possible from whereever we can to add value locally for consumption and export? or should it be to strive to be self-sufficient so that the next time a putin decides to invade a ukraine, the price of bread doesn't shoot up? the easy answer is to say: do both. but, sadly, policy bandwidth and resources to invest for strategic outcomes are often limited. sometimes, a country has to choose or choices are forced upon it. supposing ghana decides to heed mr. ezhilarasan and his scientist collaborators and work towards replacing wheat imports? a detailed study of yields across many farms in major producing regions showed that 1 acre of land can produce 1.8 tons of wheat on average. it is important to note that there are major growing regions such as australia where yields can be as low as 0.73 tons per acre. let's use 1 ton per acre for ghana. mr. ezhilarasan's dream would require 900,000 acres of land to be devoted to wheat, many multiples of the 17,000 acres he himself is securing for his arima farms. this is the amount of land needed to save $230 million of forex. ghana has 11.6 milion hectares of arable land so this requirement is less than 10% of the stock. except that wheat is expected to grow best in the north, which has 5.7 million acres of the country's arable land, of which 40% is under cultivation. in short, after accommodating land use for auxiliary agro-infrastructure like irrigation, about 30% to 35% of the remaining arable land in northern ghana must be turned to wheat production to meet the 900k production target. maybe doable. the real analysis however has barely started. you need to consider competing uses of land. and not just for agriculture. you also have to consider climactic patterns which are impacting the proportion of arable land available for cultivation. then the comparison across close options begin. despite recent drops, benchmark rice prices are still double that of wheat. and the yield per ton for rice is now higher than for wheat. thus, for the same 900,000 acres of land, you would earn more than double growing rice than wheat. of course, at a certain scale, issues of water use, pest & disease risks, and distribution/marketing factors become as determinative as yields and prices. the whole point of this post is to say one thing: making policy decisions is an inherently multi-disciplinary process, at least if done properly. one can of course establish teams with different types of expertise to power through but in the end, you need people with integrative skills. they may not make breakthroughs in any specific discipline but they will create the linkages that surface the story as a whole. if you feel irritated by policy analysts and activists because they seem to connect the dots all the time across too many subjects for your comfort, it is only because you don't fully understand the breadth of analysis needed to construct high-quality policy. whether or not ghana should prioritise wheat self-sufficiency is not a simple question that can be left to scientists at csi-csir, won't you agree?",0.08933884650468826,0.020553404465317726,0.8901077508926392,0.06878544203937054

2025-03-13 23:11:34+00:00,Agri,"yesterday, a trader suffered a brutal $200k+ loss across three transactions on uniswap v3. at first glance, it looked like a simple swap gone wrong. but after analyzing the on-chain data and how mev bots exploited the trade, it’s clear this was a textbook example of how defi users can get completely wrecked by a single mistake. in this person's case, it wasn’t just bad luck, it was a preventable disaster. the victim, likely the same individual using different addresses, executed three large swaps: - 220,000 $usdc - 131,000 $usdc - 91,000 $usdc in return, the person got…just over 10,000 $usdt in total. that’s a 99% loss. ◢ here's the main flaw in the swap the trader made these swaps on uniswap v3, but their amountoutminimum parameter (the setting that prevents slippage disasters) was set to zero. that meant their transaction would execute no matter how bad the price became. and when you’re dealing with mev bots, that’s like handing them free money. ◢ how mev bots exploited this for $200k+ profit mev bots are the sharks of ethereum’s mempool, they scan pending transactions looking for profitable opportunities to front-run, sandwich, or back-run unsuspecting traders. here’s exactly how the bot played this victim: 1. front-running the trader: the bot swapped 18 million $usdc before the victim’s transaction executed, artificially pumping the $usdt price in the pool by 44x. 2. the victim’s swap executes: with no slippage protection, the trader’s $usdc gets swapped at this highly inflated price, leaving them with almost nothing. 3. back-running for profit: the bot immediately reverses the price change, pocketing roughly $200,000 in profit while the trader gets wrecked. ◢ where the funds came from looking at the on-chain history, there’s another critical detail, all of the $usdc used in these trades was withdrawn from aave’s $1.2 billion $usdc pool about seven hours earlier. this suggests that the trader either: ► was moving funds for a larger trade strategy, but executed swaps recklessly. ► didn’t fully understand the mechanics of liquidity depth and slippage protection. either way, the mev bot was ready and waiting. ◢ how to avoid getting rekt by mev bots this wasn’t a random exploit, it was a completely avoidable mistake. if you’re trading in defi, here’s how to never end up in the same position: 1. always set slippage protection. on uniswap and most dexs, you can set a minimum amount received (amountoutminimum). this prevents bots from sandwiching you into bad trades. never leave it at zero. 2. understand liquidity depth before swapping large amounts. a single large trade can move the price against you, especially in pools with low liquidity. if you need to swap a large sum, break it into smaller trades or use an aggregator like 1inch or cow swap. 3. use mev-resistant trading platforms. cow swap, matcha, and rfq (request-for-quote) models help shield traders from front-running. mev protection is the difference between keeping profits or getting exploited. 4. watch for suspicious price movements. if a token’s price suddenly spikes before your trade, it might be an mev attack in progress. consider canceling and re-evaluating your trade. my take? defi is the wild west, and if you don’t protect yourself, the bots will eat you alive.",0.03573371097445488,0.3201318085193634,0.644134521484375,-0.2843980975449085

2025-03-17 13:26:17+00:00,Agri,"how corn took over us ag production maritime and trade aren't my only bag. i was knee-deep in ag during the transition years that brought us to today. here's a very basic longpoast primer. the long decline of the family farm - which i spent four years of my early career fighting to stop, after running a major ag export terminal - has moved in lockstep with the inverse rise in field corn monocropping. this really began (as a market signal) in 2006 when corn futures rose above the $3/bushel psychological floor on a near-permanent basis. new ethanol mandates and a down year for production in some parts of the grain belt became an arbitrage opportunity for the traders then-working the floor of the chicago board of trade. given the yield gains wrought by gmo corn tech and growing incentives for ethanol and ddgs production, larger farmers began optimizing their operations for corn in 2007 to capture the gross revenue upside now in play. however, corn's associated capex requirements for larger, more sophisticated equipment, cost and expertise required for precision farming, and necessity for large quantities of on-farm storage also drove the need for operational land base increases and predatory cash renting practices. prices for inputs such as seed, herbicides, pesticides, and trucking all rose in conjunction as the big 6 biotech companies held an oligopoly and bulk hopper truck availability bottomed out. the new economies of scale in corn meant that more farmers began planting ""corn on corn"", whereas historical practice was to rotate fields annually between corn and soybeans due to corn residue being slow to break down in the soil. natural soil fertility plummets in monocropping of corn, meaning.more labor, inputs, and fertility management to maintain soil quality. soybeans ticked up with corn due to reduced supply, and further had the virtue of not needing expensive nitrogen fertilizer (as a legume, soybeans fix nearly all of their own nitrogen). soybeans, however, also carry a premium price per bushel to corn and require less infrastructure for storage and transport. eventually, the two crops found a relative equilibrium, but the damage was done. [soybeans also had their own biofuel mandates, but biodiesel is less attractive than ethanol for a range of reasons.] now, farming in the us has undergone numerous boom/bust cycles. the advent of widespread biotech adoption finally institutionalized a new price floor and distorted historical market signals. taken together, this meant reduced optionality and variety of crops grown in the us for industrial, human, and animal consumption. farms that once produced more commodities at smaller scale folded and rented their ground out to the big boys, and led to ag exports going all-in on corn and soybeans. china, also dependent on industrial-scale volumes of corn and soybeans as well as their coproducts, consumed us exports like crazy and held the floor. but new supply from brazil and the black sea, along with tensions with the us, has eroded that dynamic in recent years. china also engaged in industrial espionage to shore up domestic production (see link to post on this in replies). today, there are fewer, larger farms still producing corn and soybeans because that's all that's left to make money on at their new economies of scale. quite simply, market distortion and perverse incentives arising from (largely) good intentions have brought us to this point. now, everyone is free to argue in the replies about ethanol, trade, tariffs, etc. try to be nice and remember that this is a major issue with numerous cross-cutting problem sets. lastly, what we can do about it, knock-on impacts to animal protein production, human and soil biome health concerns, and financialization of ag land are separate matters to this post, all of which i'm fluent in but simply didn't touch on here.",0.2565799951553345,0.15792644023895264,0.5854935050010681,0.09865355491638184

2025-03-18 07:34:30+00:00,Agri,"home-schooled and apprenticed to a bookbinder, woman of the day is suffragist emma smith (born in 1848 in london). why today? it’s the 191st anniversary of the sentencing of six farm workers from tolpuddle, dorset, to transportation for forming a trade union: the tolpuddle martyrs, 1834. that set me to wondering who the first woman was to set up a trade union. emma, born 14 years later, that’s who. she had to give up the bookbinding apprenticeship at 16 and find a job when her father died leaving his family in penury. needs must. her mother tried opening a school several times without success and emma tried working as a governess but she hated it. in july 1867, at the age of 19, she became assistant secretary to the working men’s club and institute union. it was the beginning of her dedication to trade unionism but she didn’t forget the unprotected women in the book trade. in 1873, emma took up the role of joint secretary of the central committee of the national society of women’s suffrage, working with agnes garrett, sister of elizabeth garrett anderson and millicent garrett fawcett. it didn’t go very well. she was sacked after a year. “the ladies complimented me on my zeal but they say my bodily presence is weak and my speech contemptible. so i must make room for someone who can represent them better.” undaunted, she married scottish cabinetmaker and trade unionist thomas paterson the same year and they combined their long honeymoon in the usa with visiting and researching trade unions. it was clear to emma that traditional trade unions really only represented men’s interests (what’s changed?) and she met with the female umbrella makers’ union of new york which suggested that “a general organisation of working women” was needed. in 1874, emma founded the women’s protective and provident league and generated interest by publishing an article about ‘the position of working women and how to improve it’: “it is seldom disputed that the rate of wages paid to women is, in many occupations, disgracefully low.” she followed this up with an extensive tour of the country; women’s groups started to form for each of the trades where women were unrepresented or treated as an afterthought. the first workers’ association founded by emma was the society of women employed in bookbinding in 1874. she recruited 300 members from the 7,500 or so women employed in a trade where resistance to their presence was so great that in 1879, the london society of compositors barred its members from being in the same office or even touching work carried out by women. employers weighed up the cost of the ‘alternative being a strike on the part of the men’ and sacked the women with immediate effect. appointing a woman to act as association secretary, emma did exactly the same thing with upholsterers, shirt and collar makers, dressmaking and millinery. the first women attendees at a tuc conference - glasgow in 1875 - were emma and edith simcox of london, the association secretary for shirt and collar makers. they encountered much hostility from male delegates but emma attended every subsequent conference for the rest of her life except for 1882, the year her husband died. she opposed new legislation that she believed would worsen the working conditions of factory women and reduce their wages and earned grudging respect. emma then set up the 'women's union journal', edited it, wrote most of the articles entirely centred on women, had it printed at the victoria press, whose composing room was staffed by women, and - not one to do things by halves - mastered the printer’s craft herself. in june 1876, emma set up the women’s printing society (wps), capitalised at £2,000 in £2 shares. that was serious money in those days - £195,581 today - and i can only assume that the woman whose “bodily presence” was “weak and my speech contemptible” was very persuasive. it was a sort of co-operative and provided “special facilities for the thorough training and employment of girls and women in typesetting and other light branches of printing”. apprenticeships, in other words. she couldn’t be listed as a director. the married women’s property act was still six years away and chattels (property) could not own property. it was ostensibly owned by her husband and a male supporter. make no mistake though. emma ran it and she took on other prominent feminists in key roles. in 1878, she established the women’s halfpenny bank offering women a facility to save and to apply for low-cost loans. the married women’s property act was still four years away and it attracted more than 250 depositors. emma died in 1886 at the age of 38 from diabetes. i can’t find a stirring quote from her but a male opponent at the tuc said, “her views…were always unpopular but she expressed them fearlessly.” she achieved a great deal in her short lifetime.",0.02581072226166725,0.47927334904670715,0.49491584300994873,-0.4534626267850399

2025-04-05 21:33:41+00:00,Agri,"tom marland - food for thought and thought for food a wonderful post from facebook. tom marland is very, very smart! “there are worse things than a tariff” donald j trump became a one man economic wrecking ball this week slapping pretty much everything and everyone with a tariff. he has single handedly wiped trillions off the international stock market, isolated the us from every trading partner and has basically declared a trade war with china. australia didn’t miss out and has coped a 10% across the board tariff/tax/ us- gst on the $22 billion worth of goods we ship over from the colony each year. the $2.2 billion clip will hurt - but it could have been worse. i watched on in horror when trump specifically mentioned the australian “ban” on us beef and that he was going to do the same to australian beef “as of mid night tonight”… fortunately who ever is advising trump and thought that wonderful “tariff board” was a good idea knows that there is no such thing as an australian ban on us beef and as a result of the ausfta - the us can sell what ever they want into australia for free. there was a ban placed on fresh us meat into australia in 2004 due to an outbreak of mad cows disease. this was lifted in 2019 but with tight biosecurity requirements. ironically, the us can bring as much fresh meat into australia as they want but it must be born and raised in the us. the us has requested that they be allowed to also use cattle sourced from mexico and canada but grain fed in the us. if the donald is so pro-american goods - this restriction shouldn’t be a problem. the reality is - why would an american beef producer want to sell meat into australia for $6aus a kilo when they can get $12us at home is probably why we aren’t getting swamped with texas longhorns. but despite all the rhetoric and tough talk - trump isn’t being a pain in the proverbial for fun. the reality is much more frightening. the us has a domestic debt of $36 trillion dollars (us). thats $36,000,000,000,000. this is 125% of their annual gdp. this debt is growing by $3.6 trillion per year. their interest payments have just cracked $1 trillion per year. to put that in context - australia’s entire annual gdp is $1.8 trillion. america, like most western economies, have spent a lot of money over the last 40 years on things that not only don’t make any money but cost more money in a never ending money losing cycle. in 1984 - the us debt was $1.6 trillion - roughly 40% of gdp. things like fighting unwinnable wars haven’t helped but the main burden is rising social welfare, medical and federal agency costs. elon musks brain child - doge - has slashed and burned through $100 billion in savings in a few months but this only scratches the surface of the world largest economy which is on a debt death spiral. america now has the largest external debt than any other economy in the world. as much as trump likes to claim he is running some ideological crusade against everything woke and wanting to make america great again - the reality is the us is running out of money. trumps tariffs will raise $700 billion a year. he could have made this through raising taxes or slashing government services - but he has decided to play an international game of economic brinkmanship and push the pain onto everyone else. from an australian context - we - like most south east asian counties rely solely on the us for our national defence. without the us - china could just wander down the south east asian peninsular picking daisies and jump the ditch into australia with little resistance other than bob katter with an air rifle and a few crocodiles. the us is at least making china do the honourable thing and buy us out slowly. but if they grow impatient - the only thing between us and speaking mandarin - is donald trump. he won’t be much use if the us is broke. our illustrious caretaker pm - anthony “two tone” albanese - could have seen the tariffs for what they are - an economic reality. or at least a chance for the us to have a bit of extra walk around money in the off chance china wants to make australia its new southern province. instead the peanut comes out and says it’s “not the act of a friend”. unfortunately, two tone’s economic acumen is limited to the 6 months he spent as a bank teller. his political acumen is blunted from being a life time career politician who is good at spending other peoples money without worrying about the return on investment. defence - let’s just hope he never has to lead us into battle. he could have sent in his main man in the us - chairman kevin 07 to sort the donald out….actually thank god he didn’t otherwise we would have been slapped even harder. the new tariffs are really a side show to the real bullet (excuse the pun) australia needs to bite under our aukus obligations. australia spends approximately 2% of our gdp on defence spending - or $50 billion a year. the us spends 3.5% of its gdp - about $3 trillion - to gear up to save everyone else’s bacon. the donald wants its strategic partners to match them - so australia has to find another $75 billion a year or start training some crocodiles or god forbid - give bob katter something bigger than a .22…. australia could set up a doge and find that money in the same time gout gout runs the 100. the ndis - now supporting 700,000 people and costing $50 billion a year would be a start. the ndis now costs 150% more than medicare - that looks after 95% of the population. 15% of boys in australia aged 5 to 7 are now on the ndis for behaviour management issues. just crack off the ritalin bill and give a few more boots up the arse and you'd save half. we spend about $250 billion a year in public sector wages that employs 2.5 million people. if you aren’t a nurse, teacher, policeman or doing something useful other than annoying people trying to do their actual jobs - you’re out. we spend $200 billion on social security and welfare payments per year. unless you have no legs and no arms or don't have a heart beat - back to work. i’d estimate that there would be $500 billion a year lost in productivity in australia just from trying to make the whole continent a national park. we shut down fisheries, we shut down forestry, we shut down primary industry, we shut down any use of our natural resources - because we think we are rich. we then import the same shit from poor countries and think we are saving the world. the gravy train is over - unless you want to take your chances trying to learn mandarin - australia has to remove its head from its proverbial. don’t worry about cost of living pressures. don’t worry about housing shortages. don’t worry about tariffs. don’t even worry about climate change - china clearly doesn’t. if you think life’s tough in australia now - there are 1.2 billion people fluent in mandarin that would take your spot in a heart beat - and can. and will - unless we start now.",0.08482556790113449,0.21535395085811615,0.6998204588890076,-0.13052838295698166

""some political decisions, economic decisions taken have rather undermined already soft consumer confidence,"" nestle ceo laurent freixe told journalists thursday during an earnings call. nestle, the world's biggest packaged food company and maker of nescafe and kit-kat, cut prices in the united states, its biggest market, by 1%. ""when it comes to pricing, we have to take into account the customers, the consumers, competitors' moves,"" freixe said. ""we are trying to take as much price as we can to cover our costs while being mindful of the consumer response."" dove soap maker unilever, which also reported earnings on thursday, noted ""declining consumer sentiment"" in north america, where it raised prices by only 2.1%. nestle, unilever and other makers of household products and packaged food need to show caution with price hikes to avoid alienating american shoppers who are worried about having less money to spend on groceries, industry consultants and investors said. in grocery stores, these companies compete head-to-head with retailers' private-label products, which are generally lower priced. private-label sales soar ""consumer confidence is down. we can see consumption patterns are changing, and it will remain competitive,"" kris licht, ceo of reckitt, said on an earnings call wednesday. he added that, in that context, the maker of durex condoms in the first quarter raised prices by just 0.9% in north america compared to 3% in europe and 3.9% in emerging markets. during the covid-19 pandemic, consumer goods firms lost market share to store brands made by retailers like walmart and target. rob holston, ey's global and america's consumer products sector leader, said consumer companies selling major brands of everyday products had raised prices as much as they can in recent years. ""there's a large percentage of people that will just move into private label"" options, holston said, adding that his consumer goods clients have said they're on ""war-footing"" with private label brands now. data pulled for reuters by research firm nielsen iq showed that as recently as in the first quarter, makers of major household goods brands on average kept price increases roughly flat at 2% when compared with faster price hikes of about 4% from private label brands for the same basket of goods that included categories from coffee and soap to baby food and tampons. private-label goods are still cheaper on average by at least roughly $1, according to the nielseniq data. the u.s. consumer price index increased 2.4% in march on a year-on-year basis, above the 2% rate at which big brands were recently raising prices, according to the nielseniq data. mckinsey partner patricio ibáñez said shoppers are bracing for costs to rise because of tariffs, and a survey led by the consulting firm showed 60% of people plan to shift their consumption habits by buying things that are cheaper or by switching to wholesale clubs or going to online retailers. ""we wouldn't recommend price increases,"" ibáñez said. ""private brands are growing four times faster than national (big) brands in the u.s."" 'hiding places' this trend is worrying for investors in major consumer goods companies like nestle, even though most of the firms insist their operations aren't significantly exposed to tariffs. ""it's very difficult to find hiding places for investors,"" said tom lemaigre, a portfolio manager on the european equities team at investor janus henderson. lemaigre said shoppers are thinking carefully about how they spend their money and that consumer goods companies need to figure out how to combat competition from private label brands. on shoppers can buy a 100-fluid-ounce bottle of unilever's persil liquid laundry detergent for $12.97. for $11.64, however, shoppers can buy a 154-fluid-ounce bottle of walmart's great value detergent which promises 154 loads of laundry.",0.053381968289613724,0.9288634657859802,0.017754558473825455,-0.8754814974963665

2025-05-12 21:34:57+00:00,Agri,"3-in-1 delta neutral airdrop farming in this thread i'll show my favorite strategy i've been running for the past 2 weeks to farm 3 airdrops at the same time: hyperliquid x defiapp x avantis the strategy is simple you open a long trade on one platform, while shorting the same asset with the same leverage on another platform. this makes you delta-neutral since what you are down in one place you are up on the other. the only cost is paying the fees, which we'll see how to minimize in a minute. we are hoping that the airdrops from these projects > fees spent, which is almost certain imo. there's a plethora of perp dexes to choose, so why these 3? 1) need i say more? the points page got an update recently and everything points towards another season (airdrop) incoming. trading for sure will get some rewards. hyperliquid is the next hyperliquid, don't fade them. 2) instead of launching their own perp dex they were smart and built it on top of hyperliquid. right now they don't have any extra fees, so its the same as trading on hl, except that you get xp for their points campaign (for $home airdrop). just do the trades via their ui. perps xp takes at most 48hours to be given out, you'll see a chest icon in the ui to claim it once its done. they have a swaps function too, use them once if you haven't already for another interaction with them. ah also make sure to join a faction. 3) to be honest, here you can use any perp dex that you like but there are some interesting things about avantis that make it the best for this at the moment. - backed by $4m funding from and - base native -> coinbase listing very likely - cool differentiating tech in zfp (zero-fee perpetuals) where you don't pay fees on losing trades (key for our strategy). only available for eth, btc and sol. - points campaign ends in 3 weeks -> i know what you are thinking: ""oh, its too late"". but its not. hear me out. they are running x2 xp on all trading pairs for the next 3 weeks. also they have a weekly trading competition (called leagues) which awards extra xp based on your ranking. at the end of the week the extra xp is distributed and scores are reset to 0. this pool of extra xp increases week over week. week 3 started today (so everyone's score got reset back at 0) and xp pool is 100m (twice as much as week 1). so it actually rewards late joiners. it doesn't matter if you never traded on avantis, it just makes sense to take advantage of these boosts. after 3 weeks you can go back to whatever perp dex you were using and you won't have missed a thing. also competition is low (2k traders only) and ranking up in leagues is really easy. this is the formula for their league score system: you get score points based on fees spent and losses. the strategy: remember that zfp thing we talked about? this cool tech by avantis means that when you open a trade you don't pay any opening/closing fees nor funding rate. you pay a small % fee if you profit, and nothing if your trade ends up in the negative! plus remember that the score formula takes losses into account. putting these 2 things together -> what we wanna do is try to do a losing trade on avantis using zfp (be sure to toggle this) on eth or btc, while doing the opposite trade on defiapp/hl. so you think btc will pump? go short on avantis, long on hl. if you get it right, then you only pay the hl fee (even lower if you stake 10 hype) and you get: - hl points - defiapp xp - avantis base 2x xp + league score for bonus xp at the end of the week. if you get it wrong and your avantis trade goes into profit don't worry, it only means you'll pay an extra fee when closing (which also boosts your score) but the strategy should still be profitable. one final note, aim to get into the bottom of diamond and defend the spot until next monday. its not worth it to push into higher ranks. for reference in week 2: - highest sapphire trader (poor soul): score 91 -> bonus 63,675 xp - lowest diamond trader: score 92 -> bonus 162,505 xp (almost 3x the guy beneath) - myself in mid diamond: score 250 -> 196,622.00 xp - rank 2 in diamond: score 2852 -> 213,679.58 xp as you can see pushing higher for the sake of it isn't worth it, you won't get much extra xp. the biggest bump is making the cut into diamond. risks: - avantis does not have cross margin, meaning each trade is isolated, so stick to doing either btc or eth, one at a time. - markets have been very volatile lately, so use ample margin and don't get liquidated okay that's all for today, thanks for making it until the end. i know this seems intimidating, but if you have never done this type of delta-neutral strategies i really urge you to try it out, as it will keep coming handy in the future. practice this enough and you will add another tool to your arsenal as a defi yield farmer. if you have any question or suggestions, leave them below and i'll be sure to answer.",0.0498851053416729,0.020722348242998123,0.9293925762176514,0.029162757098674774

2025-05-16 14:52:25+00:00,Agri,"“with many counter-tariffs gone, it’s time for ottawa to stop playing politics and start telling canadians the truth — the tariff narrative no longer matches economic reality.” elbows up, food prices up — until ottawa quietly backed down bloomberg reported this week that canada’s food industry is now facing fewer counter-tariffs when importing products from the united states, except for orange juice, coffee and alcohol. for many, this came as a surprise. according to the federal government’s own records, on april 16 — in the middle of the election campaign — mark carney, not yet elected, opted to eliminate most of the retaliatory tariffs imposed by his predecessor, justin trudeau. what’s more, the tariff remissions took effect on may 7, the day after carney’s first official meeting as prime minister with president trump in washington. for the food industry and consumers alike, this is welcome news. the “dollar-for-dollar” tariff response that trudeau championed was always a high-risk strategy against the world’s largest economy. these countermeasures may have fit a political narrative — propping up nationalism under slogans like “elbows up” — but they were economically counterproductive. tariffs on key food ingredients and finished goods raised costs for canadian importers, manufacturers, and ultimately consumers. the contrast with the united states is stark. despite imposing tariffs on food products from canada, mexico, and other countries, the u.s. saw food inflation fall to 2.0% in april. in canada, food inflation continues to rise. our unemployment rate is ticking upward. the u.s. jobless rate remains stable. the policy gap — and its consequences — are increasingly visible. still, the carney government’s lack of transparency is concerning. on april 10, during the election campaign, carney briefly paused his campaign to convene a cabinet committee meeting on tariffs. at the time, the move raised eyebrows. now, it’s clear he was preparing to walk back ottawa’s retaliatory measures. yet the public was not informed, at least not openly. no formal announcement was made during the campaign. voters were left in the dark — arguably to avoid alienating the elbows up base. good policy? yes. transparent leadership? not quite. the other concern is how grocers, particularly loblaw, are handling the tariff conversation. loblaw has been warning canadians of an imminent wave of price hikes due to tariffs, marking affected products with a “t” symbol in stores. according to loblaw’s communications team, the symbol applies only to finished goods still subject to tariffs — items like pasta, rice, soap, and shampoo. about half of these items are food products. they add that the government’s decision to lift tariffs on u.s. ingredients used in canadian-made goods — like granola bars — is a relief. fair enough. but it raises the question: why continue to escalate public messaging about tariff-related inflation when the federal government is clearly moving away from that approach? yes, some retaliatory tariffs remain. but the list is shrinking, not growing. the tone from ottawa has shifted. and so should the narrative from grocers. in the u.s., walmart is echoing similar concerns about price hikes, but that’s a different market with different dynamics. in canada, where supply chains are already under strain and consumer confidence is fragile, this kind of messaging from industry leaders can easily veer into fear-mongering. this entire episode — from opaque policymaking in ottawa to corporate messaging campaigns — has been frustratingly opaque. but with a new government in place, there’s reason to believe that canada’s approach to trade with the u.s. will be more strategic and less reactive. what we need now is candour. the trudeau era of performative economics is over. it’s time for both the carney government and canada’s grocers to level with canadians. the politics of fear and slogans should give way to data, transparency, and a renewed focus on affordability and competitiveness.",0.05703257769346237,0.8519927263259888,0.09097471088171005,-0.7949601486325264

2025-05-20 14:30:23+00:00,Agri,"""canada’s food inflation problem isn’t just imported — it’s engineered. tariffs, trade missteps, and performative politics have all played a role. it’s time for ottawa to stop blaming global forces and start owning the domestic decisions driving up our grocery bills."" how ottawa made your groceries more expensive it was expected, but still jarring. in april, food inflation in canada surged to 3.8% — a full 2.1 percentage points above the national inflation rate, and nearly double the u.s. rate of 2.0%. once again, food is the primary driver behind canada’s headline inflation, amplifying affordability concerns from coast to coast. behind that 3.8% figure lie significant increases across key food categories. meat prices climbed 5.8% year-over-year, with beef leading the pack at a staggering 16.5%. egg prices rose 3.9%, while fresh fruit and vegetable prices increased by 5.0% and 3.7%, respectively. these aren’t anomalies. they reflect underlying cost pressures exacerbated by recent shifts in trade policy and supply chain strategy. since march, when both canada and the united states implemented a new round of tariffs, the divergence in outcomes has been striking. u.s. food inflation has continued to cool, while canada’s has nearly tripled over the same period. tripled. in two integrated economies, this growing disparity should raise red flags. the root causes are increasingly evident. ottawa’s earlier decision to implement counter-tariffs disrupted long-standing north american procurement systems. in response, canadian grocers began pivoting away from u.s. suppliers — particularly in categories like fresh produce and frozen foods — and turned to costlier or less efficient alternatives. the results are now showing up on the grocery bill. fortunately, that policy direction has changed. according to a recent report from oxford economics, prime minister quietly eliminated many of the counter-tariffs that had been inflating food costs. the decision, while politically delicate, was economically sound — and long overdue. easing those restrictions is already beginning to relieve pressure along the supply chain. over time, this could help stabilize or even slow food price growth. but broader context matters. among g7 nations, canada now has the second-highest food inflation rate — behind only japan. food price increases in france, germany, italy, the united kingdom, and the united states remain well below canada’s. that begs the question: why is food more expensive in canada than in almost every other advanced economy? the answer is not just international volatility or climate shocks. it’s also about domestic choices. tariffs, protectionist procurement practices, and structurally limited trade flexibility have created a uniquely canadian inflation narrative — one driven more by internal policy than by external pressures. and canada’s geoeconomic leverage simply doesn’t compare to that of the united states. not even close. that’s why carney’s reversal on food-related tariffs represents an opportunity — to reset policy priorities and adopt a more pragmatic, less performative approach to affordability. canadians should welcome this shift. but they also deserve transparency. food inflation cannot be solely blamed on global disruptions or seasonal cycles. it’s time we acknowledged how much of it is homegrown. moving forward, federal and provincial governments must coordinate more effectively, communicate with greater clarity, and ensure that access to affordable, nutritious food remains a national priority. of course, there’s nothing inherently wrong with patriotic consumerism. but “maplewashing” — the marketing of imported goods under misleading “canadian” banners — is misleading and risks undermining public trust. worse, it can distort markets and push prices even higher. grocers should not abuse. as for ottawa, symbols like “elbows up” and “canada’s not for sale” may have mobilized support during a volatile political moment, but they should never substitute for sound economic governance. rhetoric can only go so far — and, in some cases, it blinds policymakers to the very consequences of their actions. canada’s food inflation story didn’t have to unfold this way. now that we have an opportunity to correct course, let’s not waste it. — dr. sylvain charlebois is the director of the agri-food analytics lab at dalhousie university and co-host of the food professor podcast, brough to you by .",0.5702698826789856,0.36360201239585876,0.06612815707921982,0.20666787028312683

2025-06-09 18:04:44+00:00,Agri,"""by protecting a shrinking sector with outdated tools, canada isn’t just coddling dairy farmers — it’s abandoning its credibility, its consumers, and its future as a serious trading nation."" our dairy addiction is making canada a trade pariah when it comes to supply management and trade policy, canada seems trapped in a cycle of repeating the same costly mistakes. before 's arrival as prime minister, the previous parliament adopted bill c-282, introduced by the bloc québécois. the bill granted blanket immunity to canada’s supply-managed sectors—most notably dairy—against any future concessions in trade negotiations, regardless of the partner or economic context. it effectively locked in protectionism for a system that is already struggling to justify itself in the modern global economy. during the federal election campaign, on april 3, mr. carney stated in a interview that no legislation was necessary to protect canada’s dairy industry. it appears he has since changed his mind—or someone changed it for him. last week, the newly elected 45th parliament unanimously passed bill c-202, a near-identical copy of c-282. the senate may still push back, as several senators have signaled concerns about the bill’s long-term economic implications. but the momentum is clear: supply management is once again being shielded from scrutiny under the pretense of national interest. politically, it’s a savvy move—especially for the . in ottawa, few mps from any party dare challenge one of the most powerful lobby in the country: the . their influence is formidable, both federally and provincially. but the question remains: what exactly are we protecting? canada has the highest industrial milk prices in the g7. this is not true for poultry or eggs—but it is for milk, a critical staple in household diets. these elevated prices do not necessarily lead to innovation or reinvestment. in fact, many producers are content to maintain the status quo, knowing the system protects them from competition. the result? canadian consumers foot the bill for a sector with little incentive to become more efficient or cost-effective. defenders of supply management often point to food safety and quality. it’s true that bovine growth hormones are banned here. that’s commendable. but there are other practices that deserve more transparency. a 2022 study published in trends in food science and technology revealed that palm oil derivatives are permitted in dairy cow feed in canada. this may contribute to the now-documented phenomenon of firmer, less spreadable butter at room temperature—a story known as “buttergate” was dismissed by dairy farmers initially, despite mounting evidence. more recently, a peer-reviewed study co-authored by researchers at mcgill and dalhousie universities and published in ecological economics estimated that canada discards between 600 million and one billion litres of milk annually. the dairy lobby vehemently disputed these findings but has yet to present alternative data. the reality is simple: cows don’t stop producing milk when market demand fluctuates, and losses—whether in volume or value—are inevitable. canada’s dairy sector has long cultivated a culture of opacity. rather than engage with critics or offer transparency, it leans on silence and self-congratulation. accountability is elusive, and reform is taboo. looking ahead, canada will need to renegotiate trade deals with the united states, mexico, and other partners. two choices await: we either pay billions in compensation to dairy farmers for theoretical “losses” each time concessions are made—a practice that borders on economic racketeering—or we forfeit our credibility as a reliable trade partner, unwilling to negotiate in good faith for a sector that represents less than 1 per cent of our gdp. what message does this send to the world at a time when canada urgently needs to diversify its economy? by clinging to a misunderstood and outdated system, our elected officials are prioritizing short-term political gain over long-term economic progress. we are rewarding complacency and institutionalizing inefficiency—all under the guise of defending national interests. the more things change, the more they stay the same. — dr. sylvain charlebois is the director of the agri-food analytics lab at dalhousie university and co-host of the food professor podcast",0.10791832953691483,0.22400487959384918,0.6680768132209778,-0.11608655005693436

2025-06-29 13:54:57+00:00,Agri,"the globalism hangover: what trump’s trade war got right “trump’s bombastic style aside, his nationalist approach to trade and food policy is forcing global institutions to justify their existence—and that’s a conversation canada can no longer afford to ignore.” for the past six months, president donald trump’s trade policies have been widely mocked, criticized, and condemned. some of it is certainly warranted. the wall street journal, for instance, recently likened his tariff-heavy approach to global trade as a direct path toward another great depression. but data out of the united states tells a more nuanced story—one that challenges conventional wisdom. despite persistent headwinds, the u.s. economy continues to outperform expectations. the federal reserve bank of atlanta projects second-quarter gdp growth at 3.8%. in may, the u.s. economy added 139,000 jobs, outpacing forecasts, while inflation remained subdued at 0.1% month-over-month and 2.4% annually. the u.s. trade deficit has been cut nearly in half, pointing to stronger export performance and a rebalancing of trade relationships. canada, by contrast, is showing signs of economic strain. the national economy is shrinking, manufacturing is struggling under u.s. trade pressure, and food inflation is outpacing general inflation. in short, our economy is not keeping pace—despite our public criticism of the trump administration. to make matters worse, the trump administration has now halted all trade negotiations with canada, signaling that our bilateral economic relationship holds little strategic value for washington. for the u.s., canada is no longer a priority—especially under a carney-led government that has visibly pivoted toward europe, a market still heavily invested in maintaining close ties with the united states. from an agri-food standpoint, this shift is consequential: access to our largest trading partner is narrowing, while ottawa appears more focused on diplomatic optics than on securing stable, competitive trade channels for the canadian agrifood economy. this is the one thing the 'elbows up' crowd never understood—and still doesn’t. we’re not in a trade war with the u.s. there’s no war to be won. for trump, this is about a realignment of the global order, plain and simple—one centered entirely on american supremacy. love him or loathe him, trump is not destroying the u.s. economy—not yet, anyway. his unapologetically nationalist agenda extends far beyond tariffs. he has withdrawn u.s. support from key global institutions such as the who and is threatening to sever ties with others, including nato and several un-affiliated agencies. among them is the food and agriculture organization (fao), the un’s most authoritative body on food security. at a recent event in brazil, a senior fao official acknowledged that fundraising dynamics have shifted. in the trump era, governments are asking harder questions: why should we fund the fao? what domestic benefit does it provide? what used to be assumed support is now conditional—and arguably, more accountable. this shift isn’t unique to washington. many countries are quietly aligning with the u.s. position, scrutinizing globalist institutions with renewed skepticism. transparency and accountability are byproducts of this anti-globalist sentiment—something not inherently negative. for decades, globalism pushed the world to believe that trade liberalization was the only viable path to growth and prosperity. it became conventional wisdom. but globalism has made some nations—and some people—richer, while leaving others behind. in the process, domestic sectors, including agriculture, were often sidelined or sacrificed in the name of global efficiency. the problem with globalism, particularly in agri-food policy, is its tendency to pursue uniformity over relevance. canada, for example, adopted the carbon tax under a globalist climate agenda that often overlooks the vital role food producers play in feeding people. instead of being supported, the sector is too often vilified as a problem. but agriculture is not a liability—it is a necessity. trump’s message—wrapped, of course, in provocative and often abrasive language—is that one-size-fits-all global policies rarely work. nations have different socio-economic realities, and those should come first. while cooperation is essential, so is recognizing local and regional priorities. in this sense, his “america first” approach is not without logic—especially when it seems to be yielding short-term economic gains. for canada’s agri-food sector, the lesson is clear: striking a better balance between global commitments and national imperatives is overdue. we should not abandon multilateral cooperation, but we must stop anchoring policy to global agendas we have little influence over. instead, let’s define what works for canadians—what supports our farmers, protects our food security, and reflects our unique landscape—while keeping the broader global context in view. we are not there yet. but if this moment of disruption sparks a more realistic and regionally attuned approach to food policy, we’ll be better for it.",0.028399532660841942,0.9129377603530884,0.05866269767284393,-0.8845382276922464
