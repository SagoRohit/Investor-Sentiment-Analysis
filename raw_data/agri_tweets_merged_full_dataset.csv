1️⃣ She gives you attention (eye contact, smiles, laughter, proximity, touch)

2️⃣ You give her investment (drinks, food, help, introductions, gifts, time)

This is NOT a good trade ❌

YOU want women who will invest in YOU… either:

➡️ In return for your investment (which should be slightly less than theirs!)

➡️ Or (even better) merely for your attention — in this case, she chases you!

Screen for this, and be aware of it:

• Is she trying to trade only her attention (but not investment) in return for greater investment from you? (bad trade)

• Or is she glad to invest in you in return for investment from you, or even just attention, allowing the romance to move forward? (good trade!)

The former girls are romantic dead ends (unless/until they change their behavior).

These migrants will get a rental house, and pile in 5-10 people in that house to keep cost of living low- OR they’re receiving government assistance and living in section 8 housing (on your tax dollars). 

They then send the money they make here to their relatives back home, where the American dollar is worth way more. 

 And finally, they move their entire families here and continue the business with their descendants, or move back home extremely wealthy. 

They have zero loyalty to America, our communities, or our businesses. An overwhelming majority of migrants and “refugees” are here entirely for economic purposes, and they’re sticking it to us. 

Americans are forced to compete against these migrants in the work force, making it impossible for a family to live on a single family income. Moms are forced to go to work, and babies are being raised by daycares- if they can even afford to have babies at all! 

Our families are the foundation of this nation, and they are in crisis.

Underfarmed and Undiluted 
Incubated by @tradeparadigm 

TLDR :
 Only 2.8k wallets ▫️ Deposit to trade or the vault ▫️ Gain XP ez ▫️ Wait for airdrops▫️

I'm in my second week at @tradeparadex, and I've already climbed to rank 839 with just a $1500 deposit into the vault🤯If this isn't underfarmed, I'm not sure what is.

I've heard that you earn less XP if you're just using the vault or engaging in wash trading, so keep that in mind.

Don't open and close trade immediately aka wash trading. Open your trade longer for hours or days.

If you're not depositing into the vault and trading isn't your strong suit, you might consider trying delta neutral hedging on another DEX.

Example : Long in Paradex, Short in Hyperliquid

You're basically burning fees to boost your trade volume, hoping that the value of future airdrops will surpass these costs. Keep an eye on the price spread and also funding rates between Dexes!

▫️According to the Discord update above from January 3rd, there are currently only 2782 wallets, with 4 million XP distributed last week. If this pool gets diluted, acquiring XP in the future could become much more challenging since it would be divided among a larger number of users.

Make sure to link your social media accounts to gain more XP and also to not get flagged as Sybil!

                   ▪️More Information▪️

▫️Founder of Paradex is also the founder of Paradigm (Not the same as VC Paradigm!)

▫️The season 2 just began on January 3rd and is expected to conclude around July 31st.

▫️The total token supply will be distributed as follows with 57.6% allocated to the community:

- 20.0% for Community Airdrop
- 26.6% for Ongoing Community Rewards (post Airdrop)
- 5.0% for Liquidity Programs
- 6.0% for Foundation Budget
- 25.1% for Core Contributors
- 3.8% for Future Core Contributors and Advisors
- 13.5% for Paradigm shareholders

❗️The concerning part is that 13.5% of the tokens held by Paradigm shareholders will be fully unlocked right at the initial listing, so keep that in mind.
--More Info: https://t.co/N54y8IHKhW

▫️In my view, we're entering this project at an early stage where it's undiluted so it's easy to earn XP without needing a huge amount of liquidity. 
Token price might dive if the shareholders decide to dump at tge but should they decide to not do that,
I believe it could be worth it given how little effort is needed to get XP.

2025-01-05 04:23:45+00:00,"The fundamental driver of economic systems isn't money – it's scarcity. 

Scarcity evolved through human history and economic thought. In ancient civilizations, the scarcity of food, land, or water was a constant concern, driving trade, agriculture, and even warfare. 

In every economy, some resources are less scarce, while others are highly limited. In today’s world, one of the scarcest commodities is attention.

While not a physical commodity, attention in the digital age has been described as a scarce commodity due to the overwhelming amount of content vying for consumer engagement. 

We're facing an unprecedented scarcity crisis in human attention spans, which have dropped from 12 seconds in 2000 to a mere 8.25 seconds in 2023. That's worse than a goldfish. Not a joke.

If your brain were a computer (it's actually way more complex), you'd have roughly 2.5 petabytes of storage. But your conscious processing power is only about 120 bits per second. This creates a brutal bottleneck. The ancient humans worried about food scarcity – we're dealing with attention scarcity.

To get this scarce commodity, you typically trade something valuable or use what you have to acquire it. 

The most straightforward method is to buy the commodity if you can afford the market price, which tends to be high due to scarcity.

For very rare items, which in this case is 'attention', auctions might be your best bet. There might be disparities in how attention is distributed, with certain platforms or creators monopolizing attention, leading to calls for fairer distribution mechanisms or platforms. 

This has spawned a $343B attention economy. Google and Meta captured 46.4% of global digital ad revenue in 2023 – essentially becoming attention monarchs.

They're not just companies; they're attention refineries, processing raw human consciousness into monetizable units.

New models of monetizing attention that respect user time and privacy could emerge, potentially involving direct payments for attention or more equitable ad-sharing systems.

Our current systems for monetizing attention are outdated—like trying to stream Netflix on a dial-up connection. The metrics are wrong. CPM (Cost Per Mille) and CTR (Click Through Rate) are industrial-age tools trying to measure quantum-level human cognition.

We need a radical redesign. Imagine:

Neural-value tokens: Direct micropayments for sustained attention, verified through biometric engagement.

Attention mining protocols: Like Bitcoin, but you're mining-focused human consciousness

Distributed attention networks: Breaking up attention monopolies through decentralized engagement systems

The real next-gen social media platform won't be about likes or shares. It'll be about creating sustainable attention economics – what I wanted to call ""attention allocation optimization.""

Humanity’s total attention budget is ~55 quadrillion bits/day (8B people × 16 waking hours × 120 bits/second). 

Out of the ~2.5 hours average daily social media time per person, only 7% represents genuine, focused engagement. We're running at 93% neural waste. Not sustainable. we're bankrupting it on cat videos and outrage algorithms.

The solution isn't just better algorithms – it's a fundamental economic redesign. We need attention UBI (Universal Basic Income), carbon credits for attention, and neural engagement futures markets. Treat attention like energy. Energy needs sustainable management. Current attention economics is the equivalent of burning coal in a steam engine – primitive and wasteful.

The future will be powered by sustainable attention. The rest is noise. 

Economic systems run on scarcity, not money.",Agri

2025-01-08 07:05:38+00:00,"Brexit trade barriers cut UK fresh produce exports, threaten food supply and affordability

Brexit continues to present challenges for food exporters and importers. 

The looming additional import checks for fresh produce exacerbate the situation, raising concerns about the future affordability and availability of fruit and vegetables in the UK.

Studies confirm a downturn in goods exports, amounting to a £27bn reduction in 2022, with the fresh produce sector among the hardest hit. 

Nigel Jenney, Chief Executive of the Fresh Produce Consortium, criticised UK government's handling of the situation, emphasising the lack of attention to the industry's proposed solutions and the potential for significant disruptions to the UK's food supply. 

The government's border strategies, particularly the Sevington BCP, are deemed ineffective and costly, with Jenney urging immediate action to prevent further impacts on the industry and consumers.

Despite govt assurances of moving forward, the fresh produce industry's challenges underscore the need for revisiting and implementing industry-led solutions to mitigate the adverse effects of Brexit on the UK's food security and supply chains.

I spotted this trade on the BSC chain and was intrigued by how little attention BSC memes are getting.

Back in the last cycle, I exclusively traded BSC memes before moving to ETH during the bear market, and then to SOL memes in the pre-bull market.

Let's not overlook the number of BNB whales from the last cycle who have yet to see an official yellow mascot for BNB. I've seen many BNB memes attempt to claim that title but fail. However, $ANDY on BSC seems to make a lot of sense.

I traded with conviction and invested heavily in $ANDY as the BSC Chain is seeing a resurgence in traffic and volume + $BNB today trades around $700 compared to last cycle it traded under $300.

Remember, the top memes from the last cycle on BSC included $BabyDoge, $Minishiba, $Babycake, and $Safemoon, among others.

This cycle, we might see a similar pattern with top memes rallying on BSC again.

2025-01-11 21:28:39+00:00,"Perpetual DEXs and DeFi Integration 🤔

Let’s dive into how perpetual DEXs fit into the larger DeFi ecosystem, including yield farming, lending, and other DeFi interactions.

Perpetual DEXs are like special trading platforms where you trade on price movements without any time limits. These platforms fit into the bigger world of DeFi by letting you do cool stuff like ""yield farming,"" where you can earn extra coins by helping keep the trading pools liquid.

Then there's ""lending"" - you can use the money you've got locked up in these trades as a kind of loan collateral. You could borrow from one part of DeFi to use in another. 

On the other hand projects like @OrderlyNetwork makes all this even cooler by working with lots of different blockchains, not just one. They've built a system where all these different blockchains can share the same pool of money for trading. So, if you're trading on Orderly, you don't even really notice you're jumping from one blockchain to another - it's all smooth. This helps because it means more people can trade together, making the prices more fair and stable.

Now, @RaydiumProtocol, which is another trading platform on the #Solana blockchain, has started using Orderly's tech to offer these ""perpetual"" trading. They've just launched its beta perpetual futures powered by Orderly Network where you can trade your assets with up to 40x the money you put in (that's leverage). It's like Raydium has now got a superpower from Orderly, letting their users play in a bigger playground where they can trade without worrying about gas fees and with lots of options, making trading a lot more fun and less of a headache.

👉¿Existen chances de devaluación en Argentina y mercados emergentes si Trump aplica aranceles a China?

🇺🇸💰TRUMP
Are there chances of devaluation in Argentina and emerging markets if Trump applies tariffs to China?
The possibility that Donald Trump applies tariffs to China could have several impacts on the devaluation of currencies in emerging markets, based on the analysis of available sources:

Increased Risk Aversion: The imposition of significant tariffs on China by the United States could increase global risk aversion. Investors could seek safer assets, generally in US dollars, which would tend to strengthen the dollar and, therefore, devalue the currencies of emerging markets.
Competitive Devaluation: In order to maintain their competitiveness in international trade, other emerging countries could be forced to devalue their own currencies. This is especially relevant if China responds to tariffs with a devaluation of the yuan, thus starting a ""currency war"" where each country seeks to make its exports cheaper.
Impact on Trade: Tariffs could divert part of global trade, benefiting emerging markets that become alternatives for production and export. However, this benefit could be offset by the uncertainty and volatility that accompany tariff policies, leading to a devaluation of their currencies due to capital outflows.
Specific Countries:

Latin America: Countries such as Mexico, Brazil and Argentina are particularly sensitive. Mexico, for example, could see a devaluation of the peso due to its close trade relationship with the United States, and its dependence on exports. 
China's response: A Chinese response to tariffs could include devaluing the yuan to keep its exports competitive, which has a domino effect on emerging markets. This scenario was seen during previous trade tensions between the US and China, where emerging market currencies depreciated significantly.
Economic Analysis: Economic experts and market analysts suggest that while some emerging markets might benefit in the short term from a trade diversion, the overall impact on market confidence and financial stability would be negative, leading to a devaluation of emerging market currencies.
In conclusion, Trump's application of tariffs on China would likely increase the pressure for currency devaluation in emerging markets due to several economic and market factors. The magnitude and duration of these devaluations would depend on the intensity of the tariffs, the political responses, and the global economic situation at the time.",Agri

Deere, which agreed in January 2023 to provide more repair tools, is criticized for equipment design requiring proprietary software. Repair costs for agricultural machinery have risen 48% since 2020, with a 2023 study estimating farmers could save $1.2 billion annually using independent mechanics. 

The FTC, investigating Deere since 2021, has targeted other companies for similar practices and supports the broader ""right-to-repair"" movement, bolstered by President Biden’s 2021 executive order.

2025-01-17 14:03:22+00:00,"There are many protocols to create, manage and trade AI Agents

Many of them have been turning into a complete no-coding environment to attract a wider set of users

@loomlayai is a good example of such protocols

Live on @base, the $LAY token is currently worth around $8.7M in market cap

The Loomlay platform has some perks giving it an edge over the rest of the no-code market ↓

Modularity

Multiple workflowss with different AI Models can be combined on $LAY to create more efficient Agents

Thanks to this modularity you can technically create an Agent scanning Base's new launches on DexScreener every day, and have it ape the best-looking ones

▪ A workflow deal with the Dexscreener Scanning
▪ A workflow analyses the findings and select the best-looking one
▪ A workflow buys on DEXs

Each of the above workflows can use a different AI model, making decisions much more efficient

All of this, built without coding knowledge

Plugins

APIs are being integrated to be used by Agents and perform a wider range of actions

There will be a whole Plugin Builder section with new plugins being integrated daily

As soon as it goes live creators will be able to make their own plugins and even monetize them

Ownership and Revenue Sharing

Once created an agent, you can mint its NFT. Holding this NFT means that you truly own this agent, you can edit it, and claim accrued fees.

Creators can then launch an ERC-20 token for their agent, which auto-pairs with $LAY on UniV3:

- no bonding curve, you can trade it on Loomlay terminal or Uniswap right-away
- 0.5% of all the buy volumes go to the creator
- 0.5% of all the buy volumes and 1% of the sell volumes get burnt forever

This creates a massive Flywheel and expands to the potential ways creators can monetize

Some extra bullish tidbits

A quarter of the entire supply has been burnt already, while 28% is within the treasury (and there are possible plans to burn that as well)

Team tokens still have to reach the 2 months cliff and then they'll be vested for 2 years

The actual circulating supply is low, and it will only get smaller with time passing

$LAY is also entering the DeFAI narrative thanks to the partnership with @BrianknowsAI

they have also integrated @zerion and @DefiLlama APIs, and are officially under DeFAI category on Coingecko

Many possible uses for it, the high level of customization provided by plugins and modularity lets anyone create the perfect AI agents for their needs

Considering that all the agents created on it will be paired with $LAY, you can expect a crazy liquidity flywheel to take place once adoption rises

Just look at #VIRTUALS and the pump post-revenues announcement

The way I see there are two options here:

1️⃣ Ape before the boom - Riskier, but if adoption rises, $LAY price will skyrocket with the biggest X possible for those already invested

2️⃣ Keep an eye on it and ape if attention rises - Less risky, but lower upside of course. Could still produce some serious Xs as you'd be ready to take action

There's a big Hackathon coming in about a month to celebrate the final touches to the platform being all polished up too

This decree, published in the Official Gazette, marks the beginning of a new era for the Argentine food industry with the focus on reducing food prices for Argentines (imports) and reaching a global scale for Argentine food (exports).

👉 Lower Food Prices for Argentines: Regarding imports, it is established that foods with certification in countries with high surveillance MAY ENTER the country WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS and will be automatically incorporated into the Argentine Food Code. The obligations to register and authorize: samples, products, establishments, warehouses, utensils and containers are eliminated.

Say goodbye to 32 pages of bureaucratic procedures!

👉Global Reach for Argentine Food: For export, all the RESTRICTIONS imposed by the Argentine State on our FOOD PRODUCERS have been LIFTED. From now on, it will not be able to ask them for anything, and will only be there to issue the certificates that the producer requires because they are requirements of the importing country.

2025-01-21 11:21:56+00:00,"In 2024, gas fees on @base increased from $4.7M in February to $27.24M in March—a 458.3% increase.

If you had taken a long position, you would have been up by 458.3%. 

But is it possible to trade transaction fees?

Yes, it is with @alkimiya_io.

Alkimiya is a decentralized blockspace marketplace that allows users to trade synthetic blockchain resources like transaction fees.

Think of it like futures trading for blockchain gas fees.

➠ Expect rising network activity? Take a long position and profit from higher fees. 

➠ Predict a slowdown? Take a short position and benefit from lower fees.

>Why you should care

➠ As a trader, you can speculate on surges in network activity (e.g., major events, market hype).

➠ Validators, miners, and stakers can hedge against fluctuating revenues by locking in future earnings.

➠ As a blockchain enthusiast, you’re no longer just watching growth—you’re directly benefiting from it.

Since its launch, Alkimiya has been empowering users to trade on the Bitcoin blockchain through its Bitcoin Feerate Marketplace, allowing traders to speculate on and hedge against the dynamic transaction fees driven by network congestion.

Now, Alkimiya is taking it a step further with the Base Gas Fee Marketplace, enabling users to engage with the growth and activity of the Base Layer 2 ecosystem. 

This new marketplace allows users to trade on the Total Gas Spent, which represents the revenue earned by Base’s sequencer and serves as a direct indicator of the blockchain’s growth.

>Why You Should Be Bullish on Base

Base has rapidly positioned itself as a leading Layer 2, showcasing extraordinary growth in key metrics:

➠ $3.42B TVL  as of January 13th, 2025.

➠ 1M daily active addresses, with 8K new addresses added daily.

➠ 11M daily transactions

➠ $542K in daily fees generated 

Whether you believe Base will continue its remarkable growth or see a slowdown ahead, the Alkimiya Marketplace lets you put your predictions to the test. 

By trading on the Total Gas Spent in the Base ecosystem—an indicator directly tied to its growth—you can position yourself for profits, regardless of market direction.

>How do you get started ↓

➠ Go to https://t.co/9WxKTB8QXZ 
➠Connect your wallet.
➠ Enter a Pool: Take a long position if you expect gas fees to rise or go short if you predict a decline in gas fees

2025-01-23 08:46:22+00:00,"How Pendle is adapting to the BTCfi movement? 

Support for Yield-Bearing BTC Assets

Pendle now supports yield tokenization for assets like wBTC and tBTC, allowing BTC holders to earn fixed yields or trade yield exposure flexibly
👉 For example: 
Perry  holds wBTC but doesn't want to sell it. He believes that BTC will continue to increase in value. Perry deposits wBTC into Pendle, receiving Principal Tokens (PT-wBTC) and Yield Tokens (YT-wBTC). 

Perry can then sell YT-wBTC immediately to receive upfront yield before maturity. If BTC price rises, Perry still retains the original BTC amount through PT-wBTC while having already secured yield profits ahead of time.
📌 So, Perry can get profit cuz: 
He doesn't need to sell BTC but can still generate yield from their assets.
He can leverage fixed or variable yield, optimizing cash flow and capital efficiency.

 Integration with BTCfi Protocols

Pendle has partnered with top BTC protocols, enabling users to tokenize and trade BTC yield.
One of the most significant integrations is stBTC (Staked BTC)—a Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) for Bitcoin. This allows BTC holders to earn staking rewards while simultaneously trading future yield on Pendle
👉 Another example:
Perry stakes BTC in the Stafi Protocol to receive stBTC, then brings stBTC to Pendle and tokenizes it into PT-stBTC and YT-stBTC. He believes BTC staking yield bullíh, so he buys YT-stBTC to maximize returns
📌The results are: earning additional staking income from BTC (without having to wait) and having more investment options.

On the other hand, how BTCfi works on Pendle? 

You own wBTC and deposit it into a lending protocol like Aave or Compound. 
Instead of simply earning passive yield, you can:
Tokenize wBTC yield on Pendle, converting it into PT-wBTC and YT-wBTC..
Sell YT-wBTC immediately to receive upfront yield, securing profits without waiting.
 Buy YT-wBTC at a discount if you believe interest rates will rise, maximizing gains..

Do you think there are any better scenarios?",Agri

Trump has selected Andrew Puzder, former Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. CEO, as his new ambassador to the European Union. Puzder, a longtime economic commentator on Fox Business, aligns with Trump’s trade-first approach to Europe.

His nomination comes as Trump prepares for a possible new trade war with the EU, reviving past tariff disputes over steel, aluminum, and other goods. If confirmed, Puzder will also navigate key issues like Ukraine aid, NATO spending, and rising right-wing movements in Europe.

Puzder’s previous nomination as Trump’s labor secretary collapsed under bipartisan scrutiny over his business record, past hiring of an illegal immigrant, and resurfaced spousal abuse allegations, which he denies.

He would replace Mark Gitenstein, a Biden loyalist, who stepped down last week.

Mastering Bearish Patterns: Trade Like a Pro

Bearish patterns are critical tools for traders aiming to anticipate potential downward price movements in financial markets. Here's a complete explanation of some key bearish patterns:

1. Descending Triangle

Definition:
The descending triangle is a bearish continuation pattern that forms when the price makes lower highs while maintaining a horizontal support level. This indicates that sellers are gaining strength, and buyers are struggling to maintain the price.

Key Features:

Lower highs form a descending trendline.

A flat support line at the bottom.

Typically breaks downward when support is breached.

How to Trade:

Enter a short trade when the price breaks below the horizontal support with significant volume.

Place a stop-loss above the most recent lower high.

Target the height of the triangle projected downward from the breakout point.

2. Head & Shoulders Pattern

Definition:
This classic reversal pattern signals a shift from an uptrend to a downtrend. It consists of three peaks: a higher central peak (head) flanked by two lower peaks (shoulders) and a neckline acting as support.

Key Features:

Left shoulder, head, and right shoulder.

Neckline connects the lows of the shoulders and head.

A break below the neckline confirms the pattern.

How to Trade:

Enter a short trade when the price breaks below the neckline.

Place a stop-loss above the right shoulder.

Measure the height from the head to the neckline and project it downward for the profit target.

3. Bearish Flag Pattern

Definition:
The bearish flag is a continuation pattern that occurs after a strong downward move. The ""flag"" represents a period of consolidation, and the breakout typically continues in the direction of the prior trend.

Key Features:

A steep downward move (flagpole).

A parallel, upward-sloping consolidation channel (flag).

Breaks downward from the flag.

How to Trade:

Enter a short trade when the price breaks below the flag’s lower boundary.

Place a stop-loss above the flag’s upper boundary.

Target the length of the flagpole projected downward.

4. Symmetrical Triangle

Definition:
A symmetrical triangle forms when the price consolidates with lower highs and higher lows, creating a triangle shape. Though this pattern can break in either direction, it often signals a continuation of the prior trend, making it bearish in a downtrend.

Key Features:

Converging trendlines.

Price oscillates within the triangle.

Breaks in the direction of the prevailing trend.

How to Trade:

Enter a short trade when the price breaks below the lower trendline.

Place a stop-loss above the upper trendline.

Target the height of the triangle projected downward.

5. Double Top Pattern

Definition:
The double top is a bearish reversal pattern that forms after an uptrend. It features two peaks at roughly the same level, separated by a trough.

Key Features:

Two similar highs.

A neckline at the trough level.

A break below the neckline confirms the pattern.

How to Trade:

Enter a short trade when the price breaks below the neckline.

Place a stop-loss above the second peak.

Measure the height between the peaks and the neckline and project it downward for the target.

6. Up Channel Pattern

Definition:
An up channel, also known as a rising channel, is a bearish reversal pattern when it forms in a larger downtrend. The price moves within two upward-sloping parallel trendlines before breaking downward.

Key Features:

Parallel upward trendlines.

Lower lows and higher highs within the channel.

Breaks below the lower trendline.

How to Trade:

Enter a short trade when the price breaks below the lower boundary of the channel.

Place a stop-loss above the upper boundary.

Target the height of the channel projected downward.

7. Triple Top Pattern

Definition:
This bearish reversal pattern forms after an uptrend and consists of three peaks at roughly the same level, indicating that buyers are unable to push the price higher.

Key Features:

Three similar highs.

A neckline at the lowest trough between the peaks.

Breaks below the neckline to confirm.

How to Trade:

Enter a short trade when the price breaks below the neckline.

Place a stop-loss above the highest peak.

Measure the height from the peaks to the neckline and project it downward for the target.

8. Bearish Rectangle Pattern

Definition:
A bearish rectangle is a continuation pattern where the price consolidates between two horizontal levels before breaking downward.

Key Features:

Horizontal support and resistance lines.

Price oscillates within the rectangle.

Breaks below the support line.

How to Trade:

Enter a short trade when the price breaks below the support line with volume.

Place a stop-loss above the resistance line.

Target the height of the rectangle projected downward.

9. Inverted Cup & Handle Pattern

Definition:
This bearish reversal pattern resembles an upside-down cup with a handle. The ""cup"" forms a rounded top, and the ""handle"" represents a consolidation phase before the breakdown.

Key Features:

Rounded top (cup).

Slight upward-sloping consolidation (handle).

Breaks downward from the handle.

How to Trade:

Enter a short trade when the price breaks below the handle’s lower boundary.

Place a stop-loss above the handle.

Measure the height of the cup and project it downward for the target.

By mastering these bearish patterns, traders can anticipate price movements and execute informed trades with confidence. Practice identifying these patterns on charts and combine them with other technical tools for optimal results.

""If Canada wants to compete globally and rely less on the United States, we must first dismantle the barriers dividing us at home.""

President Donald Trump’s provocative suggestion that Canada might as well be America’s 51st state is absurd, as Canadians know. But it is precisely this absurdity that garners attention—something Mr. Trump understands all too well. To Canadians, such comments are exasperating, but they also highlight a deeper issue: the dysfunction within Canada’s own economic framework, particularly when it comes to interprovincial trade.

Most Canadians understand this will never happen. However, Mr. Trump’s comments strike a nerve because they expose an inconvenient truth: Canada’s fragmented trade policies often make it easier to do business with the United States than with other provinces. Interprovincial trade barriers have been a longstanding issue, and provinces frequently prioritize the U.S. market, drawn by its ease of access and substantial economic returns.

Danielle Smith, Alberta’s Premier, has repeatedly voiced frustrations with Canada’s disjointed energy policies. Eastern Canada’s lack of willingness to discuss cross-country pipelines has left Alberta relying heavily on exports to the U.S. for its energy resources. The agri-food sector faces similar challenges. Provinces like Ontario and Quebec, for example, often prefer to maintain tight controls rather than foster seamless trade relationships with the rest of Canada. When trade disputes arise with the U.S., these provinces have historically been quick to sacrifice others—most notably Alberta—even though Alberta’s equalization payments financially support many of the social programs delivered in Eastern Canada.

This hypocrisy extends beyond energy and into food systems. While Alberta and British Columbia recently reached an agreement to ease interprovincial wine trade, Ontario and Quebec continue to resist efforts to smooth alcohol trade. This resistance mirrors the broader challenges of supply management, which governs the production and pricing of dairy, poultry, and eggs. Each province operates under its own quotas, making the movement of these goods across provincial borders unnecessarily complex. For instance, a dairy farmer in Quebec faces significant regulatory hurdles if they want to sell milk to processors in Ontario.

These inefficiencies directly impact Canadians. Chicken in British Columbia, for example, costs 25–30% more than in other parts of the country, despite supply management’s supposed mandate to provide safe and affordable food to all Canadians. The situation is even worse in Northern communities, where the cost of food skyrockets due to logistical barriers.

Moreover, inconsistent provincial regulations on food labeling, packaging, and grading further complicate interprovincial trade. A fruit producer in British Columbia, for instance, may need to adjust packaging to meet Ontario’s specific requirements, driving up costs and reducing competitiveness. Similarly, differing rules around transportation create roadblocks for perishable goods. Manitoba beef producers looking to sell in Quebec face delays from varying inspection protocols or transportation permits.

Small businesses and farmers also bear the brunt of these barriers. A butcher in Alberta, for example, operating in a provincially inspected facility, cannot sell beef to retailers or restaurants in neighboring Saskatchewan, even if demand exists. Likewise, variations in pesticide, fertilizer, or farm equipment regulations across provinces create logistical headaches for farmers, particularly those near provincial borders.

Even local food initiatives, designed to support regional producers, inadvertently hurt interprovincial trade. Schools in Ontario and Quebec that prioritize purchasing locally grown apples make it harder for British Columbia growers to compete.

The examples are endless, and the consequences are clear. Canada’s fragmented trade policies undermine its competitiveness, leaving provinces overly reliant on the United States for economic growth. Addressing these barriers is not only essential for fostering a stronger national economy but also for reducing vulnerabilities in times of geopolitical uncertainty.

President Trump may be wrong most of the time, but his comments sting because they point to Canada’s potential to do better. If Canada wants to become a more competitive marketplace and lessen its reliance on the U.S., it’s time for provinces to cooperate and tear down the walls that divide us.",Agri

But while fur farming is banned in the UK, fur is still imported and sold, keeping the demand alive. Animals are bred into existence, confined in cages, and ultimately killed. Not because it is necessary, but because it is profitable.

This is not just about fur. Every individual animal used for human purposes, whether for clothing, their flesh, or experimentation, is reduced to an object and denied their rights in an unjust system. These industries do not need to be 'improved' or made 'less cruel'. They need to end.

A just world is one where all animals are not objectified or discriminated against. That world is possible, but only if we reject animal use entirely.

2025-01-31 15:38:37+00:00,"Labour’s Cronyism Exposed: Ed Miliband Must Resign Over Dale Vince Solar Farm Scandal

Once again, the @UKLabour has demonstrated that it is more than willing to trade integrity for political donations, as evidenced by the latest scandal involving Ed miliband and the approval of the Heckington Fen Solar Park. Despite Labour’s attempts to downplay the issue, it is abundantly clear that a deeply concerning conflict of interest exists between the party’s financial backers and its policy decisions.

Dale Vince, the millionaire Labour donor and owner of Ecotricity, has contributed a staggering £5.4 million to the party since 2021. Now, conveniently, his company’s 524-hectare solar farm has been given the green light by the very department overseen by Miliband. Yet, we are expected to believe that this is a mere coincidence? That it just so happens a major Labour financier is receiving government approval for a project that will line his pockets? The public is not so naïve.

Miliband’s department may try to deflect responsibility by pointing to Lord Hunt as the minister who signed off on the deal, but this excuse does not wash. As Secretary of State, Miliband has ultimate responsibility for the decisions made under his watch. Either he was fully aware of the implications of greenlighting a project tied to a major Labour donor, or he is so incompetent that he failed to see the glaring conflict of interest. Neither scenario is acceptable.

Nick Timothy, the Tory MP for West Suffolk, rightly pointed out that the ministerial code explicitly prohibits ministers from allowing conflicts of interest - or even the perception of one. In this case, the perception is glaringly obvious. A major Labour donor secures approval for a lucrative solar farm while his party champions renewables at the expense of British farmland. This is textbook cronyism, and it is an insult to the British public.

Beyond the ethical failures, this decision epitomizes Labour’s reckless approach to energy policy. The blind pursuit of net zero is being used as an excuse to carve up the countryside for inefficient, intermittent, and unreliable energy projects. Britain’s farmland is being sacrificed to appease green energy tycoons like Vince, who masquerade as environmentalists while profiting from the very policies they help bankroll.

Miliband cannot simply shrug off responsibility. If Labour wants to retain any shred of credibility, he must resign. The public deserves leaders who make decisions based on the national interest, not the interests of party donors. The stench of corruption is undeniable, and unless action is taken, this scandal will serve as yet another example of Labour’s growing disregard for transparency, fairness, and the principles of good governance.

It's eliminating a customs loophole that was originally intended to allow American manufacturers to order small parts from abroad, or have family members send items to one another.

What it became was a black hole of duty avoidance schemes heavily subsidized by the USPS and other parcel carriers on this side, with vertically-subsidized Chinese manufacturers knocking off everyone else's IP and R&D to ship directly to American consumers' doors.

On top of that, apps like Temu and Shein are MASSIVE data-mining operations that allow for micro-targeting of American buyers' habits, location, and other data on their phones.

And all of that is on top of the massive amount of fentanyl and precursor trafficking that is enabled by the lack of inspections on these shipments.

If you're commenting that closing de minimis is ackshually bad for consumer prices or is a tariff, you need to simmer down, because you have zero idea what you're talking about and/or don't have the US' best interests at heart and/or need to curb your addiction to cheap crap.",Agri

""Trump’s tariffs may be a blow to Canada’s agri-food sector, but it is our own policies—fragmented regulations, trade barriers, and lack of innovation—that are holding us back the most.""

The Trump administration’s recent decision to impose a 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican food products is a wake-up call for Canada’s agri-food sector. As a nation that prides itself on food security and a robust agricultural trade surplus, Canada now faces a critical test of its ability to remain competitive in an increasingly protectionist global economy.

According to the new Global Agri-Food Most Influential Nations Ranking, compiled by the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University and commissioned by MNP, Canada ranks thirteenth among G20 nations in terms of global agri-food influence. The United States, our neighbours, are number one. While the country has high performance in food security and political stability, its weaknesses lie in innovation, trade diversification, regulatory efficiency, and interprovincial trade barriers. These vulnerabilities are now being exploited by the latest U.S. trade policy shift.

Canada’s agri-food trade surplus stands at $13.3 billion, ranking fifth among G20 nations. This surplus underscores Canada’s role as a net food exporter, supplying high-quality agricultural products to global markets, with the U.S. being the most significant trading partner. A 25% tariff on Canadian food exports will inevitably disrupt this balance, making Canadian goods less competitive in the U.S. market, leading to lower profit margins for producers, and ultimately affecting Canadian consumers.

The tariffs will also exacerbate existing challenges within the industry. The Dalhousie report highlights Canada’s struggle with high logistical costs due to its vast geography, regulatory obstacles for small businesses, and the lack of strategic investments in value-added processing. Compounding these issues are interprovincial trade barriers, which prevent efficient movement of food products within Canada itself. These barriers, ranging from differing provincial regulations to taxation inconsistencies, increase costs for producers and limit economic growth. With American tariffs cutting deep into exports, the need for Canada to build stronger trade alliances beyond the U.S. has never been more urgent.

Canada is currently classified as a Tier 2 country in global agri-food competitiveness, trailing behind Tier 1 leaders like the U.S., Japan, China, and Germany. These nations have successfully implemented policies that encourage innovation, facilitate exports, and support domestic industries through targeted investments. Canada’s fragmented regulatory framework, interprovincial trade restrictions, and inconsistent support for agri-food innovation leave it vulnerable in times of economic turbulence.

The report emphasizes the importance of domestic processing investments, which would allow Canada to capture more value from its agricultural output rather than simply exporting raw materials. This is a key area where Canada lags behind top-performing nations. With the U.S. tariffs threatening Canada’s access to its largest market, the government must act decisively to enhance domestic food processing capabilities and expand export markets in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.

The tariffs imposed by the Trump administration serve as a stark reminder that Canada cannot afford to rely too heavily on any single trade partner. Diversifying trade relationships and strengthening domestic food production and processing are now imperatives, not just aspirations.

Policy actions must include:

➡️Increased R&D Investment – Canada must prioritize research in      agri-food innovation, including advanced food processing, precision      agriculture, and sustainable farming practices.

➡️Regulatory Reform – A streamlined, transparent regulatory      environment would enable agri-food startups and small businesses to scale      up and compete internationally.

➡️Trade Diversification – Expanding trade agreements beyond North      America to markets like the European Union, Japan, and Southeast Asia      would mitigate the risks of protectionist policies from the U.S.

➡️Domestic Processing Growth – More investment in food processing      facilities would help retain economic value within Canada, reducing      reliance on raw commodity exports.

➡️Strategic Infrastructure Development – Addressing high      transportation costs and supply chain inefficiencies would enhance      Canada’s competitiveness in global food markets.

➡️Interprovincial Trade Reform – Removing barriers that limit the      free movement of food products between provinces would improve domestic      market efficiency and competitiveness.

Canada’s agri-food sector is at a crossroads. The Trump administration’s tariffs have exposed underlying weaknesses in Canada’s trade strategy and industry resilience. While Canada enjoys food security and a stable political environment, its ability to innovate and expand its global influence remains constrained by structural inefficiencies. By implementing forward-looking policies, Canada can turn this challenge into an opportunity—one that strengthens its agri-food industry and secures its place as a global leader in food production and export.

If Canada fails to act swiftly, the consequences will extend far beyond the farm gate. The time to secure Canada’s agri-food future is now.",Agri

Asking yourself “what was the trigger?” 

Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s 25% tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, which sent shockwaves through financial markets, wiping out billions in liquidations.

➜ Highlights from the Crash

× Massive Liquidations

A record $2.29 billion in crypto positions were liquidated in a single day, surpassing the FTX collapse and even the COVID-19 market crash. 

Although Bybit CEO claims it's close to $10 billion, because Bybit alone recorded $2.1 billion

× Ethereum’s Freefall

$ETH plunged 33%, hitting a low of $2,100, marking its biggest single-day drop in nearly four years. Over $600 million in $ETH liquidations added to the chaos.

× Bitcoin Also Hit

While less severe than $ETH, $BTC dropped 7%, briefly touching $91,000 as investor panic spread across the market.

× Trade War Fears

Trump’s tariff escalation sparked concerns about a global trade war, leading to widespread risk-off sentiment and aggressive sell-offs.

 × Altcoins Wrecked

Major altcoins, including $ADA, $SOL, and $AVAX, all suffered double-digit losses as liquidity dried up.

× Fear at Extreme Levels

The Fear & Greed Index now signals ""extreme fear"", but this is the signal that a buying opportunity could be near.

➜ My Take

This market shakeout was brutal, but history shows that panic-driven crashes often create the best long-term opportunities. Every major crypto downturn (from COVID-19 to FTX) has been followed by massive recoveries.

Yes, the macro outlook is shaky. A Trump presidency could bring more economic uncertainty, and a full-blown trade war would hurt global liquidity.

But smart money buys when fear is at its peak. If history repeats, this could be a prime accumulation phase before the next leg up.

2025-02-04 16:42:21+00:00,"Official Statement from Commercive on U.S. Tariff Changes

Effective February 4, 2025, the U.S. government has implemented significant tariff changes impacting imports from China:
•Complete removal of the $800 de minimis exemption, subjecting all shipments to customs duties.
•An additional 10% customs duty on all products, in addition to existing tax rates.
•Customs duties ranging from 10% to 60%+, depending on product category.

Commercive’s Strategic Response

To mitigate the impact of these changes, Commercive is implementing several proactive measures to ensure continued efficiency and cost-effectiveness for our clients:

✔ Expanding U.S.-based fulfillment operations to reduce reliance on direct imports.
✔ Enhancing our hybrid fulfillment model (China + U.S.) to maintain inventory flexibility.
✔ Optimizing bulk shipping strategies and exploring alternative sourcing options to minimize cost increases.
✔ Ensuring full compliance with new customs regulations to avoid unnecessary disruptions.

Ongoing Developments & Future Considerations

It has been reported that China and the United States are scheduled to engage in negotiations this week, which may result in policy revisions or adjustments. We are closely monitoring these discussions and will provide timely updates as more information becomes available.

However, in the event that negotiations do not lead to favorable changes, we will continue working to identify the most cost-effective strategies for our clients. Businesses should also prepare for potential pricing adjustments or market shifts as necessary.

Commercive remains committed to guiding our partners through this evolving landscape with strategic solutions and expert support. For further assistance or to explore alternative fulfillment strategies, please contact your account representative.

DePlan – the place where you can Buy, Use, Store, Send and Trade AI agents’ credits.

As predicted by majority of AI experts there will be hundreds of AI-agents per consumer by 2030. In all areas of life. From ordering ingredients for your lasagna to finding better hotels in Cairo. From creating a convincing marketing text for agency client to making a logo for your family business.

Literally, every service you can imagine will be available among AI-agents. This will create huge competition in this business!

And what it means for DePlan? Great opportunities!

DePlan AI-agents marketplace will be the best platform to start and great place to win the market. Especially taking into account the swiftness of AI in comparison to clumsy classic SaaS. The flow made by each AI-agent will need to be promoted among consumers and DePlan is the solution for this!

We want to share with you some hints of the future product look and functionality. So you better get the idea, simplicity and efficiency of DePlan for users.

Tab 1. This is the place for personal offers based on your DPLN plan. Get basic plan and you’ll be eligible for current and new listings of AI-agents, retail prices and credits offers listed by other users. Spend more and you’ll see exclusive pre-sales offers or wholesale prices.

Tab 2. If you chose one of the Premium plans (2nd and upper), you will be able to list your underutilized credits and start your own trading business.

Tab 3. Here consumers will store tokenized AI credits. Whenever you bought it, got through airdrops, or received from other consumers (you’ll be able to exchange variety of AI credits). Other consumers will be able to see what is available in your personal store and the price you nominated! Isn’t it cool! BTW, airdrops will automatically convert all users who got it into AI-agent promoters. Just because of ability to sell initial airdropped AI credits at very good initial price. Right here on DePlan platform using unique airdrop links. This will create great marketing for AI-agents and profit for consumers.

Tab 4. The wallet that reflects all your transactions. Whom, when, how much, what credits, etc. Every transaction will be recorded and saved. And of course sending of your earned crypto to external non-custodial wallets will never be easier.

This is how we create evolved DePlan.

Making a demo for you while cooking hard back in the blockchain kitchen!

Again I have no privileged info here but this makes me think hl team is going out of their way to cement this as de facto official way to trade non-native major crypto tokens on hyperliquid spot (eth and solana soon?) and that shoku's unit project has their full support and backing. I no longer expect hl team to launch their own ""official"" implementation of spot tokens (akin to bridged USDC) in the foreseeable future.

Another implication is eventual coin margined perps that many community members were expecting not far from now - without ""official"" spot implementation for non-native major tokens its hard to imagine this would be coming anytime soon, but I might be wrong on that. Hype margin is still very possible as it's a hl native asset.

Finally, regardless of what happens on the app side, I'm certain coin margined perps functionality is coming once hyperevm is out - yes it will likely be a multi step process (collateralize your major spot assets, borrow usdc and deposit to hl perps), but it still should enable much higher capital efficiency and increased activity coz of tight, vertical integration.

Starting Monday, China will impose tariffs of up to 15% on $14B worth of U.S. goods, including LNG, coal, crude oil, farm equipment, and certain vehicles, according to the FT. The move comes in retaliation to Trump's additional 10% levy on Chinese imports.

China is also targeting critical U.S. industries by restricting exports of rare earth metals used in defense, EV batteries, and solar panels. With 60% of global rare earth production and 90% of processing, Beijing’s actions underline its dominance in the supply chain.

- Never trade out of boredom. If there is no trade don't take it.

- Let go of losses. Revenge trading is one of the biggest mistakes you can make.

- Memecoins tend to do better when BTC ranges after an uptrend.

- The longer BTC ranges the less liquidity there is for small caps.

- Keep a close eye on how high new leaders go. If each peak is lower than the previous leader that is a sign.

- Understand your win condition. Some profit with low win rates because they hold one winner and some have higher win rates but more conservative targets. 

- Don't expect the perfect entry without paying more fees, especially with hyped launches.

- Execution is absolutely crucial.

- Adjust your trading style based on the market. 

- Take a break from trading if tilted. No exceptions.

- Observe more, trade less. Big wins come from few trades. 

- Fib retracements are helpful for finding dip opportunities. 

- Limit the time you spend checking on your bags. 

- Set a max drawdown limit. If you hit it walk away. 

- Avoid having too many positions open. 

- Find a process that works for you. Conviction is something you need to find for yourself. 

- Whatever you put in a trade should be considered gone. Don't expect to get it back. 

- If you can't handle the drawdowns, that means you have put too much size. 

- Never let memecoins take control of your life. Only risk what you can afford to lose—if it’s gone you need to stop.

2025-02-10 10:35:59+00:00,"George Galloway: The Last Man Standing 

Dear Comrades, Activists, Trade Unionists, and Fighters for Justice, 

Britain stands at a crossroads. The far right is on the rise, emboldened by powerful forces at home and abroad. The establishment parties have abandoned working-class communities, offering nothing but hollow promises and centrist complacency. Meanwhile, the left remains fragmented, divided by internal disagreements while our opponents grow stronger. If we do not act now, we risk losing everything we have fought for.
In this moment of crisis, one man has refused to submit. One man has stood firm against imperialism, austerity, and the betrayal of the working class. That man is George Galloway, the last man standing.
Through decades of struggle, Galloway has never wavered in his principles. He has stood against illegal wars, defended the rights of workers, and fought tirelessly for the voiceless. While others have compromised, he has remained resolute. His victory in Rochdale is not just a personal triumph, it is a signal that a real alternative is possible. But he cannot do it alone.
Now, more than ever, the British left must unite. Trade unions, socialist organizations, anti-war activists, and working-class communities must come together to form a strong, uncompromising opposition to the far right and the neoliberal establishment. The Workers Party of Britain has laid the foundation, but it is up to all of us to build a movement capable of challenging the system.
This is not about personal loyalties or old grudges. It is about the future of our country, the survival of our communities, and the principles we hold dear. If we fail to stand together now, we will watch as Britain falls further into the hands of reactionaries and profiteers.
We call on every left-wing activist, trade unionist, and concerned citizen: join us. Let us build a real opposition. Let us take back our movement from career politicians and corporate interests. Let us stand, shoulder to shoulder, with George Galloway the last man standing.
The time for hesitation is over. The time for unity is now. 

Yours in solidarity,

2025-02-10 14:56:54+00:00,"President Tinubu, responding to the economic challenges faced by Nigerians, introduced the Accelerated Stability and Advancement Plan (ASAP). This plan included a proposal for a 150-day duty-free window for food imports.

However, the Nigerian Customs Service has not implemented this proposal due to excessice regulations and rules it enacted to implement them, and as a result, this beneficial plan has yet to be implemented.

Meanwhile, the same Customs Service, which reports to the executive, has raised import prices across Nigeria by 4%.

Nigeria heavily relies on imports for various food items, particularly wheat, rice, and fish. According to the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics, food and beverages constitute the largest single expense for households in Nigeria, accounting for about 52% of the average household budget. Additionally, food is the most significant contributor to inflation in the country, making up 51% of the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

This increase in import duties will affect the entire value chain for importing, distributing, and consuming food, likely causing inflation to rise or remain high. In response to higher inflation, the administration will increase interest rates in the economy to combat the inflation it created, which makes no sense.

The government is raising import duties to address a fiscal shortfall in its record 2025 budget. The president has already increased the budget from ₦49 trillion to ₦54 trillion ($36.4 billion). He expects to gain an additional ₦1.2 trillion from the Nigerian Customs Service.

The underlying issue in Nigeria is wasteful spending, not insufficient revenue. The solution should be an austerity budget rather than more taxes and borrowing.

Households in Nigeria have struggled with rising energy costs and extremely high inflation, which adds yet another burden to their finances.

Once again, Nigeria has a spending problem, not a revenue problem.",Agri

The Federal Government, under President Bola Ahmed Tinubu GCFR @officialABAT, has made unprecedented investments in Nigerian farmers to ensure food security and affordability.

Key Achievements of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security under the leadership of @SenatorAKyari :

✅ Massive Dry Season Wheat Farming Support – 300,000 farmers were supported during the 2024/2025 wheat dry season farming, which concluded in December 2024. This included a 50% subsidy on fertilizers and a 75% subsidy on seeds, leading to an outstanding 98% redemption rate.

✅ Bumper Harvests Recorded Nationwide – The success of the last harvest season was driven by multiple government interventions, including the distribution of 2.15 million bags of fertilizers to farmers to improve yield.

✅ Farm Mechanization and Equipment Subsidy – Farmers received planters, water pumps, and other essential equipment at 75% subsidy, making modern farming tools more accessible and increasing productivity.

✅ Enhanced Farmland Security – The Agro-Rangers initiative was established to combat insecurity on farms, allowing farmers to cultivate their lands safely without fear of attacks.

✅ Renewed Hope Agric Empowerment Project for IDPs (REHAEPI) – The Ministry launched an agricultural empowerment initiative for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Nasarawa State in collaboration with @OfficialNCFRMI.
•300 IDPs and local farmers were enrolled with Otech Microfinance Bank to receive financial support.
•150 hectares of farmland and farm inputs were allocated to boost food production.
•The intervention garnered strong support from local communities, demonstrating its impact and effectiveness.
This intervention was extended to Plateau and Borno states. 

The facts speak for themselves. Nigeria is increasing food production, securing farmlands, empowering farmers, and driving down food prices. There is zero evidence to support claims that food imports are the reason for price declines.",Agri

The February WASDE report lowered global corn production for MMT to 1.212 BMT, largely driven by a reduction in South American output. Argentina’s harvest was cut by 1 MMT to 50 MMT, close to the average trade expectation, reflecting lower yields amid a prolonged drought. However, this figure remains above the forecast by local analysts. Brazil’s corn production was revised down by 1 MMT to 126 MMT, due to delays in second-crop corn planting, which may impact yield potential.

you’re not posting enough! in crypto, volume matters. one tweet a day is like trying to trade with no liquidity, ineffective.

@tvcnewsng Breakfast Program

In past years, our food production sector has suffered significant losses, leading to low productivity
and increased dependency on imports. 

However, since coming into government, we have worked
tirelessly to reverse this trend. We have provided farmers with improved seeds and essential inputs while also increasing the level of mechanization across the agricultural sector. Additionally, we have strengthened our agricultural research institutions, enhancing their capacity to drive innovation and improve yields.

As part of our commitment to supporting farmers, we are in the final stages of revamping the Bank
of Agriculture. @bankofagricng By the end of the first quarter, this process will be completed, ensuring that farmers have better access to financing. Furthermore, we are establishing a strict and credible data system to
enhance transparency and efficiency in agricultural funding and policy implementation.

The Ministry of Agriculture @NGfmafs has been working in close synergy with state governments, research
institutions, and other relevant departments to implement policies that boost food production Through these partnerships, we have enhanced extension services, improved rural infrastructure, and ensured that farmers at the grassroots level benefit directly from government programs. 

This collaborative approach is strengthening our agricultural value chain and making Nigeria more foodsecure.

As we continue to work hard in our role, I want to sincerely thank His Excellency, The President, Bola AhmedTinubu GCFR @officialABAT for his
unwavering support and commitment to agricultural transformation. His leadership has been instrumental in driving these reforms, and with his continued backing, we will achieve even greater milestones in ensuring food security and economic prosperity for our nation.

2025-02-18 18:37:23+00:00,"“Without White Farmers, South Africa Starves – The True Cost of Losing 90% of Our Food Production” 

If South Africa loses 90% of its food production and has to rely on imports, food prices would surge due to several factors:
1.Import Costs – The rand is weak, making imports expensive.
2.Transport & Tariffs – Shipping, fuel, and duties drive up prices.
https://t.co/Q3XS8sJqhL & Demand – A sudden drop in local supply would create scarcity, further driving up costs.

South Africa already imports some food, and global food price inflation has been around 10-20% in recent years. If the country suddenly had to import 90% of its food, we could see price increases of at least 200-300%, depending on the commodity.

Within the first 6 months For example:
•A loaf of bread (R18) → R54+
•10kg maize meal (R100) → R300+
•2L milk (R35) → R100+
•1kg chicken (R80) → R240+

This would crush the poor and middle class, making basic food unaffordable. The economy would spiral as inflation skyrockets, wages fall behind, and hunger spreads.

Losing farmers isn’t just about land—it’s about survival. South Africa must protect its agricultural sector to avoid disaster.

2025-02-21 07:48:57+00:00,"Did you know that China has 22% of the world’s population but only 7% of its arable land?

Yet, it has managed to ensure food security without relying heavily on imports.

❌Not through luck.
❌Not through endless expansion.
❌Not even through massive subsidies.

China’s food security strategy is built on one thing: innovation in agriculture.

Here’s how they’ve done it:

↳ Maximizing land use efficiency
China has mastered the art of getting more from less. Farmers in rice-growing regions use the same paddy fields to raise fish.
↳ Carp fish thrive in flooded rice paddies, feeding on insects and algae, reducing the need for chemical pesticides.
↳ Once the fish mature, ducks are introduced to eat snails and insects, further controlling pests naturally.

This integrated system increases productivity without requiring additional land.

↳ Expanding arable land
China is actively converting once-barren land into productive farmland.

↳ Scientists have developed salt-resistant rice varieties that grow in coastal regions, turning previously unfarmable land into fertile ground.
↳ Desertification control projects are reclaiming vast stretches of desert and transforming them into agricultural hubs.

↳ Embracing technology
Agricultural modernization is at the heart of China’s food security plan. The use of drones in farming has revolutionized food production:
↳ Lower labor costs
↳ Optimized irrigation
↳ Improved pest control

Contrary to claims of forced labor in cotton fields, mechanization has taken over most tasks, making manual labor largely unnecessary.

↳ Innovative farming locations
China has found ways to produce food in unconventional environments:
↳ Pigs raised in multi-story buildings and forests instead of traditional farms
↳ Sheep grazing under solar power plants, combining livestock farming with renewable energy production
↳ Deep-sea fish farming, including salmon, to increase seafood production

The results? China has transformed its agricultural sector into a high-tech, high-efficiency system that sustains its massive population.

Even at the household level, families make use of every available space. 

Instead of ornamental lawns, many urban and rural Chinese grow vegetables in their yards.

I once traveled to Xian, China, and was amazed to see farmers growing corn on tiny patches of rocky terrain—where only a few square meters were available for cultivation.

↳ The key takeaway? 

Food security isn’t just about having more land—it’s about making the most of what you have.

So, what lessons can other nations learn from China’s approach?

2025-02-22 15:48:05+00:00,"Canada’s Internal Trade Fix? Anand’s Plan Leaves Major Barriers Untouched 

“Supply management is the linchpin of Canada’s internal trade dysfunction, keeping food prices high and stifling competition. While Ottawa celebrates minor progress in removing trade barriers, the real roadblock remains untouched—an outdated system that prioritizes protectionism over affordability and efficiency.”

Minister @AnitaAnandMP, the outgoing Liberal minister, recently announced that over 60% of Canada’s internal trade barriers will soon be eliminated. Ottawa claims to have removed 64% of federal exceptions in the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA), though it has yet to release a list of the 20 newly removed exceptions—expected next week. While this is a commendable step, it falls short, particularly in the food sector, where inefficiencies persist due to longstanding protectionist policies.

While much attention has been given to interprovincial restrictions on alcoholic products—an issue rooted in Canada’s regulatory history—barriers in the broader food sector remain just as problematic. Nova Scotia and British Columbia boast the highest number of vineyards per capita in the country, yet both provinces struggle to sell their world-class products to Canadians in other regions. This inefficiency is emblematic of Canada’s broader internal trade dysfunction.

Multiple studies, including reports from the @CdnChamberofCom, the @OECD, and the @CompBureau, estimate that eliminating interprovincial trade barriers could save Canadians up to $9 billion annually on food alone—excluding potential savings in the restaurant sector. For the average Canadian, this could translate into more than $250 in yearly savings. However, most of these savings’ hinge on reforming supply management, a policy that remains politically untouchable for the current government.

Anand’s continued shielding of supply management in dairy is problematic. Eggs and poultry also operate under supply management, but these sectors have demonstrated a long-standing tradition of coordinated governance and strategic collaboration among provincial marketing boards, ensuring stability and efficiency across the supply chain. That is not the case in dairy.

Supply management functions as a quota system that limits imports through tariffs exceeding 200% on certain products from countries like the United States. This system, while benefiting a concentrated group of producers, drives up domestic prices, creating artificial inefficiencies in Canada’s food economy. Quebec remains the epicenter of protectionism, benefiting disproportionately from these internal trade barriers. Despite housing just 20% of Canada’s population, Quebec produces nearly 40% of the nation’s milk. The provincial control over quota allocation ensures that Quebec’s dairy industry operates in a closed system, effectively blocking competition from other provinces and maintaining inflated prices.

A truly free and competitive dairy market in Canada would require federal harmonization of quota allocations and the elimination of provincial dairy boards. This would allow all provinces an equal opportunity to produce milk and butterfat competitively, rather than permitting smaller, less efficient Quebec farms to dictate national pricing structures. Removing these artificial constraints would introduce greater efficiency into the sector, benefiting consumers and non-Quebec producers alike. Yet, political considerations have consistently obstructed any meaningful reform.

Quebec Premier @francoislegault’s insistence that supply management is “not negotiable,” as stated in Washington, underscores the entrenched nature of these policies. However, his stance is increasingly untenable in the face of mounting economic evidence that these trade barriers impose significant costs on consumers and hinder national competitiveness.

Beyond dairy, regulatory fragmentation across provinces stifles food manufacturing. If a food product is deemed safe for sale in Nova Scotia, it should logically be permitted for sale in Alberta, Ontario, or Quebec. Yet, under the current system, manufacturers and processors with only provincial licenses can sell exclusively within their province. 

Even federally licensed facilities must navigate redundant bureaucratic hurdles to access domestic markets. Enforcing mutual recognition of food safety standards across provinces would significantly reduce these inefficiencies, allowing beef and pork processors, seafood producers, and other food manufacturers to expand their markets without costly regulatory duplication.

Such reforms would be transformative, particularly for the economies of Atlantic Canada and the Prairies, regions that would benefit from improved market access. Increased competition would lower costs for consumers, strengthen regional food industries, and foster a more dynamic national economy. Yet, resistance from entrenched interests continues to stifle progress.

Minister Anand’s announcement is a step forward, but it does not address the fundamental inefficiencies that continue to plague Canada’s food economy. The CFTA was designed to facilitate internal trade, yet its multiple exemptions continue to allow provinces to uphold protectionist policies at the expense of consumers and businesses. The federal government has long championed international free trade agreements but has failed to secure genuine free trade within its own borders.

While Anand’s announcement represents incremental progress, it is far from sufficient. Until Canada takes decisive action to eliminate all interprovincial trade barriers—including those protecting supply management—consumers, businesses, and entire regions will continue to bear the burden of political inaction.",Agri

2025-02-26 13:39:52+00:00,"Nova Scotia Smashes Food Trade Barriers—Will the Rest of Canada Follow?

""Interprovincial trade barriers have quietly strangled economic growth for decades—Nova Scotia just proved that breaking them down is not only possible but necessary for a stronger, more competitive Canada.""

The federal government can talk endlessly about eliminating interprovincial trade barriers, but ultimately, it is up to the provinces to take real action. Canada now has a clear front-runner in this effort: Nova Scotia.

Premier @TimHoustonNS and his government have recognized the steep cost that interprovincial trade barriers have imposed on their province and the Atlantic region. Being geographically distant from major markets has already put Nova Scotia at a disadvantage, making it difficult to compete against larger provinces unless a sector has developed a unique competitive edge—such as the province’s thriving wine industry. However, with trade barriers limiting access to larger provincial markets, growth in the food sector has been stifled.

Now, Nova Scotia is raising the stakes. Bill 36, the Free Trade and Mobility within Canada Act, is a significant step forward in eliminating these internal trade obstacles. The legislation ensures that goods manufactured or produced in another province or territory that comply with that jurisdiction's regulatory standards will not be subjected to additional fees or testing by Nova Scotia.

Premier Houston put it succinctly:

“If it’s good enough for another province, it’ll be good enough for Nova Scotia because I trust other provinces and territories to have appropriate requirements that keep their citizens safe.”

But this commitment to trade liberalization must be a two-way street. Other provinces—and the federal government—need to follow suit. It’s called mutual recognition, and it should become the standard nationwide.

For the food industry, this means that any provincially licensed facility across the country can provide ingredients and products to Nova Scotia’s food manufacturers, restaurants, and retailers—so long as their home province reciprocates and accepts Nova Scotia-made products. This shift would enhance consumer choice, drive competition, and create opportunities for small businesses. The result? Lower prices, more innovation, and stronger regional economies.

The Economic Toll of Protectionism

For too long, interprovincial trade barriers have prioritized protectionism over value, quality, innovation, and economic growth. These barriers were largely invisible but economically devastating, preventing smaller provinces like Nova Scotia from reaching their full potential. In theory, Canadian provinces should have the easiest trade relationships in the world—no border brokerage, no international regulatory alignments—yet internal barriers have choked opportunities for decades.

If mutual recognition were to expand across the country, many provinces stand to gain significantly, particularly Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Atlantic Canada. Removing unnecessary regulatory duplication will stimulate investment and growth in key sectors, including agri-food.

Overcoming Resistance

Of course, passing legislation like Bill 36 is the easy part. The real challenge lies in overcoming opposition from special interest groups, unions, and industry lobbies that resist competition and mutual reciprocity. These groups have long benefited from protectionist measures that shield them from outside competitors. A truly open internal market would mean fewer government-mandated inefficiencies and could threaten some entrenched provincial interests.

A common argument against mutual recognition is that it could erode provincial identity—particularly when it comes to food. But identity and culture do not emerge from regulation; they thrive on innovation and passion. The belief that strict provincial regulations are necessary to preserve distinctiveness is misguided. True uniqueness in food and agriculture is not built through bureaucratic red tape—it is built through ingenuity and consumer trust.

What’s Next?

Nova Scotia has set the bar high. Other provinces should take note: economic protectionism is outdated, and interprovincial trade reform is long overdue.

Now, @TimHoustonNS, perhaps it's time for a conversation about another major trade barrier within Canada—our overpowering provincial marketing boards, particularly in the dairy sector.

(And why this booming industry is transforming agriculture)...

Once considered a niche crop...

Avocado farming in Africa is now a multi-billion dollar industry.

High global demand. Rising exports. Increased farmer incomes.

Here’s how the top producers rank:

🇰🇪 Kenya – 416,802.72 tonnes (Leading Africa’s avocado boom, supplying major markets in Europe and beyond)
🇪🇹 Ethiopia – 152,505.49 tonnes (Rapidly expanding avocado farms with government support)
🇲🇼 Malawi – 93,872.16 tonnes (Smallholder farmers benefiting from avocado’s growing popularity)
🇿🇦 South Africa – 82,677 tonnes (A key exporter with well-established avocado plantations)
🇲🇦 Morocco – 82,369 tonnes (Strategic production targeting European markets)
🇨🇲 Cameroon – 75,116.32 tonnes (Avocado farming on the rise as a lucrative cash crop)
🇨🇩 DR Congo – 63,372.05 tonnes (Small-scale farmers tapping into avocado’s high value)
🇨🇮 Ivory Coast – 35,993.35 tonnes (Increasing investment in avocado production)
🇲🇬 Madagascar – 27,309.59 tonnes (A new player in the avocado export market)
🇹🇿 Tanzania – 176,045 tonnes (Expanding cultivation as demand surges)

Why this matters:
↳ Africa’s avocado exports are soaring, driven by global health trends.
↳ Farmers are earning more, with avocados offering higher profits than many traditional crops.
↳ Sustainable farming practices are being promoted to ensure long-term production growth.

What’s next for Africa’s avocado industry?

With increasing investment, better farming techniques, and new market opportunities...

African avocados could dominate the global market in the coming years.

Sometimes, all it takes is recognizing the value of a crop and scaling smartly.

💬 “With the grain export season winding down, trading activity is expected to slow further, which could exert additional but limited downward pressure on freight rates in the short term, Ivanov noted. However, in the medium to long term, an upward correction may emerge as older vessels exit the market,”  Ivanov noted.

2025-03-03 20:51:09+00:00,"A few years after completing his university studies in Chennai, India, Mr. Ezhilarasan headed to Tamil Nadu to find his fortune in the construction materials trade.

A decade later, he has another mission: hitting it big with farming in Ghana.

Mr. Ezhilarasan believes that the North of Ghana is a massive bread basket with huge untapped opportunities. He has secured large land concessions to grow grains. 

Now, he wants to make Ghana self-sufficient in wheat. 

He has thus teamed up with a bunch of smart Ghanaian scientists at CSI-CSIR to come up with wheat varieties that will grow well in the country's soils and climate.

Ghana is on course to import about 900,000 tons of wheat this year at a cost of about $230 million. The question he and the scientists are asking is: why the hell not grow all that wheat in Ghana and pocket the bucks?

I doubt they intended that effect, but Mr. Ezhilarasan and the scientists have opened the door for a discussion of elementary trade economics and national production policy. Should Ghana prioritise growing its own wheat?

Wheat is interesting in Ghana because the country has built the capacity to add value to a lot of it. Very different from, say, rice and tomatoes, which are imported primarily for consumption. Wheat imports, by contrast, are mainly for production inputs in Takoradi and Tema.

Just like Japan or the Netherlands would import a lot of cocoa from Ghana to turn into chocolate, Ghana imports wheat from Canada, Argentina, the US, and others, mainly to mill into wheat flour. Wheat flour is the base ingredient for bread and other bakeries, which are almost staple foods in Ghana. 

If Japan and the Netherlands don't bother to grow cocoa, should Ghana grow wheat? Let's look at a few numbers.

Ghana has four wheat flour factories with a capacity to produce 800,000 tons of wheat flour a year. If they were running at full capacity, 1.05 million tons of wheat would be needed. Instead, they currently consume about 680,000 tons of imported wheat to produce about 500,000 tons of wheat flour, and some leftover bran and feed mill.

The likes of Takoradi Flour Mills, for instance, will sell a ton of their wheat flour for about $740. If we use this as a trading benchmark, then from the 680,000 tons of imported wheat (~$160m), Ghanaian factories create value of about $400m. 

A rough rule of thumb is that from 1 ton of wheat flour, you can make about 1,300 loafs of standard-sized bread that costs about $1.3 each. Of course, other ingredients are involved (as is the case when considering cocoa to chocolate as well). Still, it is interesting to see that about $1.7m in value is generated from about $170m of wheat imports.

It bears noting, as I have said already, that the factories are operating at just above 60% average capacity. And that Ghana imports wheat flour to the tune of about $37 million (roughly 140,000 tons) so there is still room for Ghanaian flour manufacturers to grow. Most importantly of all, Ghanaian flour manufacturers are yet to even tap into the export market.

Should the priority be to get wheat as cheaply as possible from whereever we can to add value locally for consumption and export? Or should it be to strive to be self-sufficient so that the next time a Putin decides to invade a Ukraine, the price of bread doesn't shoot up? 

The easy answer is to say: do both. But, sadly, policy bandwidth and resources to invest for strategic outcomes are often limited. Sometimes, a country has to choose or choices are forced upon it.

Supposing Ghana decides to heed Mr. Ezhilarasan and his scientist collaborators and work towards replacing wheat imports?

A detailed study of yields across many farms in major producing regions showed that 1 acre of land can produce 1.8 tons of wheat on average. It is important to note that there are major growing regions such as Australia where yields can be as low as 0.73 tons per acre. 

Let's use 1 ton per acre for Ghana. Mr. Ezhilarasan's dream would require 900,000 acres of land to be devoted to wheat, many multiples of the 17,000 acres he himself is securing for his Arima Farms. This is the amount of land needed to save $230 million of forex. 

Ghana has 11.6 milion hectares of arable land so this requirement is less than 10% of the stock. Except that wheat is expected to grow best in the North, which has 5.7 million acres of the country's arable land, of which 40% is under cultivation. In short, after accommodating land use for auxiliary agro-infrastructure like irrigation, about 30% to 35% of the remaining arable land in Northern Ghana must be turned to wheat production to meet the 900k production target. Maybe doable.

The real analysis however has barely started. You need to consider competing uses of land. And not just for agriculture. You also have to consider climactic patterns which are impacting the proportion of arable land available for cultivation.

Then the comparison across close options begin. Despite recent drops, benchmark rice prices are still double that of wheat. And the yield per ton for rice is now higher than for wheat.

Thus, for the same 900,000 acres of land, you would earn more than double growing rice than wheat. Of course, at a certain scale, issues of water use, pest & disease risks, and distribution/marketing factors become as determinative as yields and prices.

The whole point of this post is to say one thing: making policy decisions is an inherently MULTI-DISCIPLINARY process, at least if done properly. 

One can of course establish teams with different types of expertise to power through but in the end, you need people with integrative skills. They may not make breakthroughs in any specific discipline but they will create the linkages that surface the story AS A WHOLE. 

If you feel irritated by policy analysts and activists because they seem to connect the dots all the time across too many subjects for your comfort, it is only because you don't fully understand the breadth of analysis needed to construct high-quality policy.

Whether or not Ghana should prioritise wheat self-sufficiency is not a simple question that can be left to scientists at CSI-CSIR, won't you agree?",Agri

A significant amount of that tariffed food which we import will soar in price, as the cost will ultimately be paid by the consumer.

It's one thing when the Americans make Canadian exported food more expensive in their country, soaring prices as local farmers need to recover, but it's another when the food we cannot make ourselves is made more expensive by our own government's decision.

How much will we see the prices of American fruits and vegetables increase? 

That's a question genuinely worth looking into, because the United States can still produce crops in many of their states while we're covered in snow.

How many Canadians will find that basic fruits and vegetables are unaffordable with our currency decaying as import taxes are raised on them?

""Buying Canadian"" is near impossible thanks to our current trade system.

For example, grain grown in Canada is often shipped to the United States to be refined into cereal, which is then shipped back here to be sold. That cereal, while originally Canadian, is now affected by tariffs.

This opens an opportunity for adjustments, even if the effects of these tariffs are scathing.

Our current supply management system punishes farmers, stores, and consumers by unfairly rigging the system into one plagued by business cartels in the egg, poultry, and dairy industries.

2025-03-04 22:32:20+00:00,"The Cost of Retaliation: Canada’s Trade War Misstep

""Canada cannot win a trade war by taxing its own people—true leverage comes from targeting American reliance on our exports, not undermining our own food security and economy.""

The trade war between us and the American is no longer just academic. It’s real, and Canada is at the center of one. In response to escalating tariffs from the United States, Canada has chosen to retaliate. While standing up to protectionist policies is necessary, the Federal Government’s approach could ultimately harm Canadian consumers far more than it impacts American interests.

Placing tariffs and taxes on food and essential goods that Canadians rely on is not just a poor economic decision—it is a direct attack on our own food security. It is impossible to win a trade war against the United States, the most powerful economy in the world, and the strategy of imposing retaliatory tariffs will likely yield more tariffs in response. The end result? A prolonged economic downturn that will hit Canadians the hardest.

The reality is that these tariffs act as a tax on Canadian consumers. Every additional cost imposed on imported goods translates into higher prices at the grocery store, increased costs for businesses, and a greater financial strain on households. The government may attempt to justify this as necessary pushback against U.S. trade policies, but the truth is simple: Washington will not bear the brunt of this burden—Ottawa’s own citizens will.

The federal government’s strategy not only risks exacerbating inflation but could also tip Canada into recession. As disposable incomes shrink and household budgets tighten, consumer spending—a major driver of economic growth—will decline. Instead of punishing American trade aggressors, Canada is punishing itself.

A more effective response would be to shift the burden onto U.S. consumers by implementing taxes on Canadian exports such as potash, beef, pork grains, and canola oil—commodities that the U.S. heavily relies on. This strategy would maintain leverage over the American market while avoiding unnecessary harm to Canadian households. Instead, Ottawa has chosen to disguise this tax grab as a patriotic countermeasure against the U.S., misleading Canadians into believing that it will make a difference. The government not only collects revenue through the tariffs themselves but also benefits from the additional 5% GST on these higher-priced goods. This is not sound economic policy—it is an economic miscalculation.

At a time when food affordability is already a pressing issue, Canadian policymakers should be seeking ways to support consumers, not further strain them. Provinces and citizens alike must recognize that better tools exist to navigate trade disputes, ones that do not come at the cost of food security and economic stability.

With a new leader set to take charge in Canada within days, the future of these policies remains uncertain. However, one thing is clear: continuing down this path will only lead to greater hardship for Canadian families. It is time for a change in strategy—one that protects Canada’s interests without inflicting unnecessary pain on its own people.",Agri

Christina Serebriakova, CEO of ASAP Agri & Broker at Atria Brokers:

🔹Can Mexico replace U.S. corn with Brazilian supplies?
ASAP Agri’s parent company, Atria Brokers, recently opened an office in Brazil and surveyed local corn exporters. Their feedback? There is currently little demand from Mexico for Brazilian corn. U.S. logistics also provide a major advantage, with an extensive rail network enabling cheaper and faster transport, whereas Brazil relies on more expensive ocean freight.

🔹 Is the U.S. hurting its own farmers with widespread trade wars?
We spoke with Matt Emmerman, Risk Management Manager at StoneX, about where excess U.S. soybeans and corn might go if Mexican demand weakens. He noted that U.S. corn has already adapted to China’s absence, but losing Mexico would be much more disruptive, but there is still some time left for U.S. origin at least until Brazilian corn becomes available in the summer.

About more insights on potential changes in the Ukrainian grain market due to Trump’s tariffs, Christina Serebriakova, CEO of ASAP Agri, will share in a detailed analysis during a panel discussion at the EuroGrainExchange 2025 conference, taking place on April 10-11 in Bucharest.

""Canada keeps picking fights it can’t win—now our farmers are paying the price for Ottawa’s reckless trade policies.""

Canada has walked itself into an unnecessary trade war with the United States’ biggest geopolitical rival, China. The consequences are now clear: new retaliatory tariffs from China are directly targeting our farmers, affecting over $3 billion in agrifood commodities and products. These measures are a direct response to Canada’s decision to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) back in October—a move designed to align with U.S. trade policy and shield the North American auto sector from low-cost competition. But now, the landscape has shifted: Joe Biden is no longer in office, Donald Trump is signaling hostility toward Canada, and China is retaliating against Canadian farmers. 

Canada has been in this position before. During the Huawei affair in 2018, China employed similar tactics. When Meng Wanzhou, a top Huawei executive, was arrested in Vancouver, China swiftly imposed restrictions on Canadian canola, pork, and other agricultural exports. China’s geopolitical strategy is calculated and effective, targeting industries that will generate maximum pressure on the Canadian government. By contrast, Canada’s trade policy is often reactionary, driven by optics rather than strategic long-term planning.

Now, China is once again sending a clear message by targeting Canadian farmers in retaliation for an EV tariff—even though Canada has yet to import a single Chinese-made electric vehicle. This comes on the same weekend that Canada installs a new prime minister to replace Justin Trudeau, the leader who originally imposed the tariffs. China waited months to do this. The symbolism is undeniable, yet it remains unclear whether Ottawa grasps the significance.

At the heart of this issue is Canada’s flawed strategy on EVs—a policy that mirrors the protectionist nature of supply management in the dairy sector. The federal government has poured over $50 billion into the EV and battery industries, supporting domestic manufacturing, critical minerals, and supply chain development. Beneficiaries include Volkswagen, Stellantis-LG Energy Solution, Northvolt, and Honda, among others. To protect these investments, Ottawa followed the U.S. lead in imposing tariffs on Chinese EVs, effectively limiting market competition and driving up domestic EV prices over time.

This raises an important question: if the Canadian government is serious about climate action, shouldn’t it prioritize making EVs more affordable rather than blocking cheaper imports? Instead, Ottawa has chosen to prioritize jobs in the auto sector over environmental concerns. The inconsistency is staggering.

Meanwhile, the EV and battery industries Canada is trying to protect remain in their infancy. We are not importing Chinese EVs, yet our agricultural sector is bearing the cost of this policy misstep.

To put the misallocation of funds into perspective, let’s consider what else could have been achieved with the $50 billion funneled into EVs and batteries. The beef sector, a vital component of Canada’s food security, offers a compelling case study.

With $50 billion, the meatpacking industry could be revolutionized. A mid-sized meatpacking plant costs roughly $200 million to build, meaning these funds could support the construction of approximately 250 plants, each capable of processing between 500 and 2,000 cattle per day. Alternatively, large-scale industrial plants, like those operated by Cargill and JBS, typically cost $800 million each, meaning this investment could fund around 62 massive facilities, each capable of handling 4,000 to 7,000 cattle daily. For context, Cargill’s High River plant processes 4,000 cattle per day, while JBS’s Greeley facility in the U.S. handles about 5,000. This level of investment would decentralize the North American meat supply chain, increase competition, and improve food security by reducing reliance on a handful of dominant processors.

The lack of foresight in Ottawa’s trade and industrial policies is astonishing. If a country controls its food supply, it holds far greater economic and strategic leverage. China understands this well. The question now is whether Canada’s next government will learn the lesson before more damage is done to our farming sector.",Agri

Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning’s Regular Press Conference on March 10, 2025

Global Times: U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on multiple occasions stressed that the Chinese economy is over-dependent on export and that the U.S. wants fair and reciprocal trade ties. What’s China’s comment?

Mao Ning: You can find in this year’s Report on the Work of the Government that “stimulating domestic demand across the board” is listed as the first of the ten major tasks for this year. The report also stresses that China will vigorously expand domestic demand across the board and make it a key driver and stabilizing force for economic growth.

The China-U.S. trade, as it is now, is the result of market forces with multiple factors at play, including the two countries’ economic structures and trade policies as well as the position of the U.S. dollar. China never seeks a trade surplus. The fact is, the U.S. has benefited abundantly from trade with China. If you look at the breakdown of statistics, the exports of China-based U.S. companies are also counted as China’s trade surplus. The high-quality products at reduced cost exported by China to the U.S. have essentially raised the purchasing power of U.S. consumers, and created a huge amount of jobs in the U.S., particularly in sectors such as transport, wholesale, retail and e-commerce. By the way, the U.S. continues to run a huge surplus in trade in services.

China-U.S. trade and economic ties benefit both sides. If one had been ripping the other off, there is no way the ties would have come this far as we see today. To call the economic ties a “rip-off” and pursue absolute reciprocity in trade goes against the most basic economic common sense and those who do so are underestimating the judgement of U.S. companies and consumers. No matter what the purported rationale is, it cannot hide the U.S.’s aim of politicizing and weaponizing trade issues to contain and go after China. It’s been years and years since the U.S. initiated the trade war against the rest of the world, yet it has not stopped U.S. trade deficit from going up and reaching US$918.4 billion last year. Whether it’s a tariff war or a trade war, they invariably start by hurting others before coming back to hurt the one who launched it.

After publication of March corn WASDE report, CBOT futures increased a bit, as global corn ending stocks were trimmed by 1.4 MMT to 288.9 MMT, below the average trade expectations. Meanwhile, U.S. corn stocks were left unchanged, despite market expectations for a reduction. 
This cut was done mostly on reconsideration of 2023/24 MY balance. The estimate of 2023/24 crop was cut for Brazil by 3 MMT to 119 MMT, and raised for Argentina by 1 MMT to 51 MMT. 
Meanwhile, 2024/25 MY global corn production was lowered only slightly by 0.3 MMT to 1.212 BMT, with 1 MMT reduction to South Africa to 16 MMT was offset by upward revision of crop estimates for russia (+0.75 to 14 MMT) and Ukraine (+0.3 to 26.8 MMT).

2025-03-13 23:11:34+00:00,"Yesterday, a trader suffered a brutal $200K+ loss across three transactions on Uniswap V3. At first glance, it looked like a simple swap gone wrong.

But after analyzing the on-chain data and how MEV bots exploited the trade, it’s clear this was a textbook example of how DeFi users can get completely wrecked by a single mistake.

In this person's case, it wasn’t just bad luck,  it was a preventable disaster. The victim, likely the same individual using different addresses, executed three large swaps:

- 220,000 $USDC
- 131,000 $USDC
- 91,000 $USDC

In return, the person got…just over 10,000 $USDT in total.

That’s a 99% loss.

◢  Here's the Main Flaw in the Swap ⬇️

The trader made these swaps on Uniswap V3, but their amountOutMinimum parameter (the setting that prevents slippage disasters) was set to zero.

That meant their transaction would execute no matter how bad the price became. And when you’re dealing with MEV bots, that’s like handing them free money.

◢  How MEV Bots Exploited This for $200K+ Profit

MEV bots are the sharks of Ethereum’s mempool, they scan pending transactions looking for profitable opportunities to front-run, sandwich, or back-run unsuspecting traders.

Here’s exactly how the bot played this victim:

1. Front-running the trader: The bot swapped 18 million $USDC before the victim’s transaction executed, artificially pumping the $USDT price in the pool by 44x.

2. The victim’s swap executes: With no slippage protection, the trader’s $USDC gets swapped at this highly inflated price, leaving them with almost nothing.

3. Back-running for profit: The bot immediately reverses the price change, pocketing roughly $200,000 in profit while the trader gets wrecked.

◢ Where the Funds Came From

Looking at the on-chain history, there’s another critical detail,  all of the $USDC used in these trades was withdrawn from Aave’s $1.2 billion $USDC pool about seven hours earlier.

This suggests that the trader either:

► Was moving funds for a larger trade strategy, but executed swaps recklessly.

► Didn’t fully understand the mechanics of liquidity depth and slippage protection.

Either way, the MEV bot was ready and waiting.

◢ How to Avoid Getting Rekt by MEV Bots

This wasn’t a random exploit,  it was a completely avoidable mistake. If you’re trading in DeFi, here’s how to never end up in the same position:

1. Always set slippage protection.

On Uniswap and most DEXs, you can set a minimum amount received (amountOutMinimum).

This prevents bots from sandwiching you into bad trades. Never leave it at zero.

2. Understand liquidity depth before swapping large amounts.

A single large trade can move the price against you, especially in pools with low liquidity.

If you need to swap a large sum, break it into smaller trades or use an aggregator like 1inch or CoW Swap.

3. Use MEV-resistant trading platforms.

CoW Swap, Matcha, and RFQ (request-for-quote) models help shield traders from front-running.

MEV protection is the difference between keeping profits or getting exploited.

4. Watch for suspicious price movements.

If a token’s price suddenly spikes before your trade, it might be an MEV attack in progress.

Consider canceling and re-evaluating your trade.

✍️ My Take?

DeFi is the Wild West, and if you don’t protect yourself, the bots will eat you alive.",Agri

Amid a volatile trade environment, the global corn market continues to be shaped by fundamental factors. While Brazil’s corn production is expected to rise, its exports may fall short due to growing local consumption. Meanwhile, expectations for a record U.S. yield may be overly optimistic.

💬 ""The USDA AgForum estimates rely on both acreage growth and record-high yields. Given that last year’s record yield was achieved under generally favorable weather, repeating that performance in 2025 will be challenging,"" says Alina Fedyay-Zyrianska, Global Grain Research at Avere Commodities at the 12 March Trend & Hedge Club online meeting, where ASAP Agri serves as an information partner.

Key insights fir new season:
📌 Brazil: Higher output (128 MMT) but lower exports (40 MMT) as ethanol demand surges.
📌 Argentina: Smaller crop (47 MMT) but stable exports (36 MMT) – farmer selling behavior is key.
📌 Ukraine: Expanded planting could boost production to 30 MMT, with 25 MMT in exports.
📌 U.S.: More acreage, but record yields remain uncertain.

You might invest in something and hope it pays off.

You might hold a trade overnight, trusting the market won’t betray you.

Sometimes you wake up richer, other times, you wake up humbled.

But yield farming isn’t the kind of risk you can take blindly.

It is not just about chasing high APYs (Annual Percentage Yields) and expecting profits. 

A pool that looks great today might be worthless tomorrow. 

That’s how people end up in exit liquidity group chats.

And let’s not even start on the scams.

New farms pop up daily, promising high returns, only to disappear overnight. 

Even legit pools can become unprofitable if you are not watching closely.

The main issue is that yield farming is not passive.

To actually make money, you need to track pools non-stop, monitor liquidity shifts, dodge rug pulls, and somehow move your funds at the perfect time without losing sleep.

Or… you could let @HedgeAI_ do all that for you.

It constantly scans farms, tracks risks, and moves assets when needed so you are not glued to charts 24/7, trying to outsmart the market.

Why not simply take what we want by force? Is it because we’re “good people” or bound by some statist fairytale called the “social contract”? 

No—because trade, voluntary exchange, is positive-sum. Money, then, is not merely a Medium of Exchange; it is the facilitator of voluntary exchange.

This is what John Pierpont (JP Morgan) alluded to when he remarked, “Gold is money, all else is credit.” Not because gold possessed some mystical “moneyness,” as the shiny-rock fetishists believe, but because gold—being as trustless as anything could be in old JP’s time—could be relied upon where man could not. 

Nature provides a fairer game than the promises of men ever could.

Bitcoin transcends gold: 
a fixed supply, a transparent ledger, non-physical and weightless. Not just a product of nature’s happenstance, but a system defined and secured by Her immutable mathematics. Not merely the use of a physical good to represent an abstraction, but the abstraction itself—the Platonic ideal of Value made cryptographic flesh.

2025-03-17 13:26:17+00:00,"HOW CORN TOOK OVER US AG PRODUCTION 🌽

Maritime and trade aren't my only bag. I was knee-deep in ag during the transition years that brought us to today. Here's a very basic longpoast primer. 

The long decline of the family farm - which I spent four years of my early career fighting to stop, after running a major ag export terminal - has moved in lockstep with the inverse rise in field corn monocropping.

This really began (as a market signal) in 2006 when corn futures rose above the $3/bushel psychological floor on a near-permanent basis. New ethanol mandates and a down year for production in some parts of the grain belt became an arbitrage opportunity for the traders then-working the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade.

Given the yield gains wrought by GMO corn tech and growing incentives for ethanol and DDGS production, larger farmers began optimizing their operations for corn in 2007 to capture the gross revenue upside now in play.

However, corn's associated capex requirements for larger, more sophisticated equipment, cost and expertise required for precision farming, and necessity for large quantities of on-farm storage also drove the need for operational land base increases and predatory cash renting practices. Prices for inputs such as seed, herbicides, pesticides, and trucking all rose in conjunction as the Big 6 biotech companies held an oligopoly and bulk hopper truck availability bottomed out.

The new economies of scale in corn meant that more farmers began planting ""corn on corn"", whereas historical practice was to rotate fields annually between corn and soybeans due to corn residue being slow to break down in the soil. Natural soil fertility plummets in monocropping of corn, meaning...more labor, inputs, and fertility management to maintain soil quality.

Soybeans ticked up with corn due to reduced supply, and further had the virtue of not needing expensive nitrogen fertilizer (as a legume, soybeans fix nearly all of their own nitrogen). Soybeans, however, also carry a premium price per bushel to corn and require less infrastructure for storage and transport. Eventually, the two crops found a relative equilibrium, but the damage was done.

[Soybeans also had their own biofuel mandates, but biodiesel is less attractive than ethanol for a range of reasons.]

Now, farming in the US has undergone numerous boom/bust cycles. The advent of widespread biotech adoption finally institutionalized a new price floor and distorted historical market signals.

Taken together, this meant reduced optionality and variety of crops grown in the US for industrial, human, and animal consumption. Farms that once produced more commodities at smaller scale folded and rented their ground out to the big boys, and led to ag exports going all-in on corn and soybeans.

China, also dependent on industrial-scale volumes of corn and soybeans as well as their coproducts, consumed US exports like crazy and held the floor. But new supply from Brazil and the Black Sea, along with tensions with the US, has eroded that dynamic in recent years. China also engaged in industrial espionage to shore up domestic production (see link to post on this in replies).

Today, there are fewer, larger farms still producing corn and soybeans because that's all that's left to make money on at their new economies of scale. Quite simply, market distortion and perverse incentives arising from (largely) good intentions have brought us to this point.

Now, everyone is free to argue in the replies about ethanol, trade, tariffs, etc. Try to be nice and remember that this is a major issue with numerous cross-cutting problem sets. Lastly, what we can do about it, knock-on impacts to animal protein production, human and soil biome health concerns, and financialization of ag land are separate matters to this post, all of which I'm fluent in but simply didn't touch on here.",Agri

2025-03-18 07:34:30+00:00,"Home-schooled and apprenticed to a bookbinder, Woman of the Day is suffragist Emma Smith (born in 1848 in London). Why today? It’s the 191st anniversary of the sentencing of six farm workers from Tolpuddle, Dorset, to transportation for forming a trade union: the Tolpuddle Martyrs, 1834.

That set me to wondering who the first woman was to set up a trade union. Emma, born 14 years later, that’s who.

She had to give up the bookbinding apprenticeship at 16 and find a job when her father died leaving his family in penury. Needs must. Her mother tried opening a school several times without success and Emma tried working as a governess but she hated it. In July 1867, at the age of 19, she became assistant secretary to the Working Men’s Club and Institute Union. It was the beginning of her dedication to trade unionism but she didn’t forget the unprotected women in the book trade.

In 1873, Emma took up the role of joint secretary of the Central Committee of the National Society of Women’s Suffrage, working with Agnes Garrett, sister of Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and Millicent Garrett Fawcett. It didn’t go very well. She was sacked after a year. “The ladies complimented me on my zeal but they say my bodily presence is weak and my speech contemptible. So I must make room for someone who can represent them better.”

Undaunted, she married Scottish cabinetmaker and trade unionist Thomas Paterson the same year and they combined their long honeymoon in the USA with visiting and researching trade unions. It was clear to Emma that traditional trade unions really only represented men’s interests (what’s changed?) and she met with the Female Umbrella Makers’ Union of New York which suggested that “a general organisation of working women” was needed.

In 1874, Emma founded the Women’s Protective and Provident League and generated interest by publishing an article about ‘The Position of Working Women and How to Improve It’: “It is seldom disputed that the rate of wages paid to women is, in many occupations, disgracefully low.” She followed this up with an extensive tour of the country; women’s groups started to form for each of the trades where women were unrepresented or treated as an afterthought.

The first workers’ association founded by Emma was The Society of Women Employed in Bookbinding in 1874. She recruited 300 members from the 7,500 or so women employed in a trade where resistance to their presence was so great that in 1879, the London Society of Compositors barred its members from being in the same office or even touching work carried out by women. Employers weighed up the cost of the ‘alternative being a strike on the part of the men’ and sacked the women with immediate effect.

Appointing a woman to act as association secretary, Emma did exactly the same thing with upholsterers, shirt and collar makers, dressmaking and millinery.

The first women attendees at a TUC conference - Glasgow in 1875 - were Emma and Edith Simcox of London, the Association Secretary for shirt and collar makers. They encountered much hostility from male delegates but Emma attended every subsequent conference for the rest of her life except for 1882, the year her husband died. She opposed new legislation that she believed would worsen the working conditions of factory women and reduce their wages and earned grudging respect.

Emma then set up the 'Women's Union Journal', edited it, wrote most of the articles entirely centred on women, had it printed at the Victoria Press, whose composing room was staffed by women, and - not one to do things by halves - mastered the printer’s craft herself.

In June 1876, Emma set up the Women’s Printing Society (WPS), capitalised at £2,000 in £2 shares. That was serious money in those days - £195,581 today - and I can only assume that the woman whose “bodily presence” was “weak and my speech contemptible” was very persuasive. It was a sort of co-operative and provided “special facilities for the thorough training and employment of Girls and Women in typesetting and other light branches of printing”. Apprenticeships, in other words. She couldn’t be listed as a Director. The Married Women’s Property Act was still six years away and chattels (property) could not own property. It was ostensibly owned by her husband and a male supporter. Make no mistake though. Emma ran it and she took on other prominent feminists in key roles.

In 1878, she established the Women’s Halfpenny Bank offering women a facility to save and to apply for low-cost loans. The Married Women’s Property Act was still four years away and it attracted more than 250 depositors.

Emma died in 1886 at the age of 38 from diabetes. I can’t find a stirring quote from her but a male opponent at the TUC said, “Her views…were always unpopular but she expressed them fearlessly.” She achieved a great deal in her short lifetime.",Agri

A key area is tackling subpar quality control and standardization, ensuring that all produce meets exportation standards. There is a need for conversation regarding Agricultural certification and food safety. 

This is why we are excited about our upcoming Webinar on the 27th of March. It is an opportunity to get informed and address issues on certification and grey areas regarding food safety and compliance.

Turkey’s newly announced 1 MMT corn import quota with a 5% tax won’t necessarily trigger immediate demand. Why? 

🔹 Limited to 8 KMT per transaction + 7-day wait rule slows imports

🔹 Bonded warehouses are already full, says Gözde Nur Karagöz (Pir Grain & Pulses): ""Buyers will likely use existing stocks before turning to new imports.""

However, Koray Tüysüzoğlu (Erser Group Turkey) predicts that demand will remain strong: ""I don’t believe this will actually slow down corn imports. Demand for coasters will stay high. Most importers will discharge into bonded warehouses and wait without customs clearance.""

However, she emphasized that no official announcement or documentation has been issued yet.

Since 1990, U.S. imports have surged from under $500 billion to over $3 trillion in 2023, with the trade deficit widening from $100 billion to more than $1 trillion. Globalization has played a key role, allowing businesses to source materials and components worldwide to stay competitive.

The U.S. maintained strong trade relationships with China, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and the European Union. China, in particular, became a dominant supplier after joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, though tensions and tariffs since 2018 have reduced imports by $100 billion in 2023. 

Meanwhile, trade with Canada and Mexico has been bolstered by NAFTA and its successor, the USMCA, reinforcing economic ties across North America.

2025-03-21 13:30:00+00:00,"Good Morning everyone.

A brief summary of yesterday's news and trendy topics:  Local news by Bitty the Bag Lady reporting from The Hobby Farm News pasture.

BREAKING NEWS:  Trump’s economic policies continue to dominate headlines, with new tariffs stirring markets and international relations. Yesterday, reports emerged that his administration is preparing additional tariffs set for April 2, targeting trillions of dollars in imports from Canada, Mexico, and China. This follows earlier duties imposed this month, with the EU delaying its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods like whiskey. Economists note a shift in market narratives from “U.S. exceptionalism” to recession fears as Trump’s trade war intensifies, with the average U.S. tariff potentially nearing 20%, a level unseen since the 1930s.

EXECUTIVE ORDER NEWS:  President Trump signed an executive order today aimed at eliminating the U.S. Department of Education, fulfilling a major campaign promise. The move, announced at a White House ceremony, has sparked widespread reactions. Trump described the department as a “big con job” and emphasized supporting teachers regardless of union status, a rare positive nod to educators from him. Critics, including education advocates, warn of potential chaos in federal education funding, while supporters cheer it as a blow to bureaucratic overreach. Technical details of the shutdown will require congressional cooperation, with Education Secretary Linda McMahon tasked with overseeing the transition.

COLORADO BREAKING NEWS: On March 20, 2025, thousands of Colorado teachers, including many from Denver, rallied at the State Capitol against Governor Polis’s 2025-2026 budget, which cuts expected school funding by $150 million via a single-year enrollment count. Organized by the Colorado Education Association, 2,000-3,000 educators protested for sustainable funding in a system short $4.1 billion annually, closing over 100 Denver schools and others statewide. Facing a $1.2 billion shortfall and TABOR limits, Polis calls it a $138 million increase, but critics disagree. Tensions are heightened by costs like Denver’s $356 million for immigrants since 2022, though broader issues dominate. Teachers marched, chanting “Fund our schools,” pushing for a 2026 ballot fix.

LOCAL BREAKING NEWS:  Good morning everyone.  This is Bitty the The Bag Lady reporting from the Local Hobby Farm Studio.  Today as you can see the food dispensing waitress attempted to place a paper bag around my precious self.  The other traitorous pasture animals have staged a protest and got the attention of the not so clever food dispensing waitress.  Their pleas to have me quarantined fell on deaf ears but their insistence that my newly shaved body parts be hidden beneath a paper bag were heeded.  Alas for the poor waitress as she approached with the wrinkled McDonalds bag she found in the garbage can.  Fury seldom seen was unleashed upon her outstretched arms.  The tussle lasted for several moments as she attempted to get photo evidence to present to the pasture agitators.  I am only wearing the bag at this moment to show you why I fought so hard to preserve my dignity.  How could anyone want my majestic fur to be hidden from view.  Even shaved under the armpits and down one side does not diminish my extraordinary beauty.  That's all to report today this is the one and only time you will see me wearing a bag.  Enjoy the moment.

Let’s talk about something exciting today. You’ve heard me mention AI, DePIN, and L1 tech, but what does that really mean for you?

Well, @Chain4Energy is changing how we use and trade energy. Imagine a world where:
➙ You control your energy - buy, sell, or share renewable power with no middlemen.
➙ AI helps you save money - by making your energy use more efficient.
➙ EV charging is smarter - no long waits, just easy and fair charging.

Sounds amazing? It’s already happening

And C4E is taking it even further with AI-Enabled Energy Communities, powered by @Fetch_ai! This means:
➜  Smarter energy management
➜ Lower costs & optimized usage
➜ Rewards for sharing surplus energy
➜ Localized power resilience
➜ A greener, more sustainable future 

Now, let’s talk EVs

Did you know?
⇛ China will sell 12M+ EVs in 2025, more than gas cars for the first time!
⇛ Europe’s EV market will grow 40%, reaching 2.7M sales next year.
⇛ By 2030, half of all new cars will be electric!

This is why ChargEra matters. Their smart charging system will:
➻ Make EV charging easy - No stress, just plug and go.
➻ Balance power use - So energy is always available when needed.
➻ Ensure fair prices - No overpaying, no surprises.

With more EVs hitting the roads, smart energy solutions are a must.",Agri

2025-03-26 03:19:09+00:00,"2025, day 85

Good morning from Asia.

The U.S. insists a Russia-Ukraine Black Sea ceasefire has been agreed, lifting restrictions on Russian agri and fertiliser exports in response, even as Russia says it first wants the full lifting of sanctions on its banks in SWIFT, which would require EU approval;

If Europe gives it, where then its statecraft? If it doesn’t, where then U.S.-EU relations?

Meanwhile, reports have U.S. intel saying Russia and Ukraine may  prefer a longer war to a quick settlement unsatisfying to either. The U.S. also still sees a risk that Russia may resort to nuclear weapons;

There’s a marked U.S. air power buildup in Diego Garcia, a base for past strikes on the Middle East, which looks more than required for the Houthis. That doesn’t leave much to the imagination in terms of potential targets: what does is if this is the Ukraine-for-Iran Noxin strategy, or just a national security Signal; as

Local word is the U.S. remains deadly serious about a Saudi-Israel peace deal, and soon, and has conveyed that re: time limits on new fighting in Gaza;

VP Vance is going to visit Greenland in Friday, following his wife’s lead, which some local politicians call “aggressive.”;

The U.S. has added around 70 Chinese entities to its export control blacklist to prevent helping Chinese AI and military development;

The White House has nominated an ex-navy staunch advocate for rebuilding the U.S. merchant marine to lead the U.S. Maritime Administration MARAD, suggesting more impetus towards shipbuilding;

President Trump signed an Executive Order enabling the Treasury to modernize its payments system to reduce waste, fraud and abuse; and another making U.S. election day just that. Naturally, this will end up in court too;

The U.K. will today have a gloomy Spring Statement filled with austerity and spending cuts, because “the world has changed.” Yes - largely towards military Keynesianism elsewhere. (Even if a UK-EU defence agreement is being held by over French demands over fishing rights.);
 
By contrast, Australia had pre-election tax cuts and populist spending increases on energy rebates in its budget. And no sign at all of any economic statecraft about what its GDP is *for* other than for trying to win an election;

U.S. consumer inflation expectations rose significantly once again, now up to 6.2%. Also rising are U.S. firms’ prices paid indices, while their business confidence dips;

HSBC says globalisation as we knew it is over, news to those still saying this is just a meme; 

The Trump family are offering a stablecoin backed by U.S. Treasuries to go with their meme coins backed by their surname;

Foreign Affairs points out ‘China Has Already Remade the International Order’ and everyone else is mirroring their mercantilism, as I’d specifically flagged back in 2017;

Branko Milanovic qualifies that the U.S. has domestic neoliberalism and international mercantilism; and China has domestic mercantilism and international neoliberalism. 

And what is Europe (the U.K., Australia, NZ, etc.)  going to do vs those two statecraft extremes? “A bit of neoliberalism and a bit of mercantilism” isn’t a workable compromise.",Agri

“Looks like another nod to Moscow,” Sizov wrote on X, adding that the move could indicate that U.S. sanctions on Rosselkhozbank, a state-owned agricultural bank, would be lifted.

In a later phone call, however, Sizov emphasized that the U.S. proposal was so vague, it was “hard to know if it was an actual concession.”

He added that some key aspects of sanctions relief, such as the reconnection of Rosselkhozbank to the SWIFT, would require cooperation with Europe.
…

While global food prices spiked in 2022 after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, they have remained far lower in the years since then, according to U.N. statistics. Sizov said he thought it was unlikely that the U.S. proposal on Tuesday would affect global prices.

“Wheat prices are already 30 percent lower than they were before the war, despite the lack of a ceasefire, lack of a grain deal,” he said.

Or so you thought.

One day, you're about to execute a massive trade, timed perfectly to front-run a major announcement. You hit ""Confirm.""

And then… BOOM.

Transaction fees spike out of nowhere. Your transaction gets stuck. The priority fee surges, and suddenly, a trade that should've been profitable bleeds money before it even settles.

You cancel. Try again. Same issue.

Now you're staring at the screen, watching MEV bots feast on the volatility while you sit there, helpless.

How did it come to this? You planned everything. But there was one thing you couldn’t control, blockspace volatility.

Transaction fees, arbitrage, rollups, priority fees, these aren’t just network costs. They’re the hidden force behind every on-chain move.

And yet, for years, traders have been reacting to them instead of trading them.

Think about it, stocks have options, forex has futures, but blockspace? It’s been a wild, untamed beast. Until now.

Enter @TheHedgehog_io, the first Modular Synthetic Blockspace that lets you trade, hedge, and speculate on the cost of doing business on-chain.

Instead of being at the mercy of transaction fees, you can now profit from them.

Here’s how it works:
➻ Trade Base Fees Like an Asset – Buy low, sell high, just like any other market.
➻ Hedge Against Spiking Transaction Fees – No more sudden cost surges wrecking your trades.
➻ Predictable Costs for Businesses – Paymasters, relayers, and DeFi protocols can lock in stable fees.
➻ Beyond Ethereum – Hedgehog extends to Bitcoin fees, Funding rates hedging, Celestia DA costs, and more.

It’s a financial layer for blockspace, abstracting away complexity and unlocking a whole new trading arena.

Hedgehog Protocol is live on testnet, launching on @SonicLabs in Q2, and already gaining traction.

➻ Three projects have committed to integration.
➻ Discussions ongoing with major L1s.
➻ Telegram MiniApp launching soon.
➻ Backed by industry leaders like Vasiliy Shapovalov (Lido), Ivangbi (Gearbox), Banteg (Yearn), and more.

The days of being at the mercy of transaction fees are over.

With Hedgehog, blockspace is no longer an expense, it’s an opportunity.

Be part of the revolution.

2025-03-27 22:44:33+00:00,"How Carney Supports Farming So Far.

To help canola farmers deal with China's 100% tariffs, the government made a flashy announcement just before the election, doubling the maximum AgriStability payout from $3 million to $6 million per farm. But in reality, the extra support won’t help most farms. It’s more about optics than substance. Farmers must still be enrolled in AgriStability—a program many have opted out of because it hasn't worked well for them. Plus, if other parts of the farm are profitable, payouts are reduced. The support ends up being worth very little in practice...

And for the Auto Industry?

Carney is promising a $2 billion fund for the auto sector as Trump imposes a 25% tariff on imported vehicles starting April 2. Nice for Central Canada, but...

The response for farmers feels very familiar—reminiscent of the Trudeau years: big announcements, limited impact for farming.

2025-03-28 08:29:50+00:00,"Choosing UK Meats Supports Superior Animal Welfare
When it comes to the food on our plates, the story behind it matters. That’s something that created the business I’m in (online retail). 
For those who care about animal welfare, opting for UK meats over foreign imports is a choice that aligns with compassion, quality, and ethical standards. The UK has long been recognized as a leader in animal welfare, with rigorous regulations and farming practices that prioritise welfare in livestock. 
In contrast, many imported meats come from countries with less stringent standards, where cost-cutting often trumps the humane treatment of animals. 
But why do UK meats stand out and why does making this choice make a difference? 
The UK boasts some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world, shaped by decades of legislation (working with the government 🤔) and a culture that values ethical farming. Laws here ensure that animals are raised with care, from spacious living conditions to strict rules on transport and slaughter. For example, UK pig farmers use farrowing crates only briefly to protect piglets, while in many exporting countries, sows are confined in tiny pens for most of their lives, or animals fattened in stalls which are essentially cages. 
Poultry farmers in the UK are capped at a maximum stocking density of 38kg per square meter—equivalent to about 15 birds—allowing chickens room to move, whereas in some foreign systems, densities can soar by a third more, cramming animals into tighter spaces.
Beef production - banned in the UK are practices like castration without anesthetic, hot branding, and dehorning without pain relief. 
Yet, in countries like Brazil, which supplies 3% of the UK’s imported beef, these painful procedures remain common and and routine. The UK’s organic standards go even further than this, for example insisting on free-range small poultry flocks of no more than 500 birds, ensuring animals have access to the outdoors and a more natural life. This commitment to welfare isn’t just a legal box to tick, it’s a promise to treat animals with care and respect.
Contrast this with the reality of many foreign imports. A significant portion of meat sold in the UK (at least a quarter by some estimates according for Grok AI) comes from countries who care less for the animal and more about the profit. 
Bacon, pork, and poultry from nations with weaker regulations often originate in overcrowded sheds or cage-like systems that would be illegal here. This is a fact. 
In parts of the EU, for instance, higher stocking densities are permitted, while in places like Australia, lamb imports may involve mulesing—a painful procedure to remove skin from sheep’s hindquarters to prevent maggots in the wool, this is outlawed in the UK. 
The UK’s standards are backed by regular inspections and a robust legal framework. 
Choosing UK meats isn’t just about animal welfare—it’s about supporting a system that works. British farmers operate under high standards that come with higher costs, from better feed to more land per animal. When we buy cheap imports produced in sub standard conditions, we undercut farmers, risking a downward spiral where they’re forced to compete by cutting corners (which we never will) 
By choosing UK meats, we bolster a market that rewards ethical practices, ensuring that high welfare remains the norm, not the exception…. Oh and it tastes better too. Thought I’d throw that in there 😂 
So… next time you’re at the butcher or supermarket, consider this: every pound spent on UK meat is a vote for a system that puts animal welfare first. Look for labels like Red Tractor, RSPCA Assured, or Soil Association Organic—they’re your guarantee of standards foreign imports often can’t match. 
Yes, imported meat might be cheaper, but the hidden cost is borne by the animals. 
By choosing British,you’re supporting a legacy of care, sustainability, and quality that’s worth every penny

In a major win for small-scale food producers and peasant farmers in Kenya, “the Kenya Court of Appeal blocked the Kenyan government from importing genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into the country,” according to a press release by Alliance for Food Sovereignty in Africa—an alliance of organizations and movements across the continent advocating for agroecology and food sovereignty. 
“We celebrate this ruling as a major victory for small-scale farmers across Kenya,” said David Otieno, a small-scale farmer and member of the Kenyan Peasants League, a social movement consisting of consumers, farmers, pastoralists, and fishers rallying against the multinational corporate takeover of food systems in Kenya. 
Mr. Otieno continued: “GMOs are not the solution to food insecurity in our country. Instead, they deepen dependency on multinational agribusinesses, threaten biodiversity, and compromise farmers’ ability to control their food systems.”

Keep up the great work, Kenya!

2025-03-29 20:07:03+00:00,"As early as 10 000 BC women in Africa pioneered organised cultivation, thereby creating the pre-conditions for surplus, wealth and trade.

African women are responsible for the greatest invention for the well being of human kind, namely, food security. It is the practice of organised agriculture that made population expansion, food surpluses and the emergence civilisation possible.

Pre-capitalist matriarchal civilisations in Africa included the Nigerian Zazzau, Sudanese Kandake, Angolan Nzinga, and Ashanti of Ghana, to name but a few. The quintessential African matriarchal system was most evident and most enduring in black Ancient Egypt.

Women in Ancient Egypt Kemet owned and had complete control over both movable and immovable property such as real estate in 3000 BC. As late as the 1960s, this right could not be claimed by women in some parts of the United States.

A closer look at ancient Egyptian papyrus' reveals that society was strictly matriarchal and inheritance and descent was through the female line. The Egyptian woman enjoyed the same legal and economic rights as the Egyptian man, and the proof of this is reflected in Egyptian art and historical inscriptions.

Kemet was an unequal society, but the inequality was based much more upon differences in the social classes, rather than differences in gender. From ancient legal documents, we know that women were able to manage and dispose of private property, including: land, portable goods, servants, slaves, livestock, and financial instruments such as endowments and annuities.

A woman could administer all her property independently and according to her free will and in several excavated cemeteries the richest tombs were those of women.
The independence and leadership roles of ancient Egyptian women are part of an African cultural pattern that began millennia ago and continued into recent times, until Europeans brought capitalism and Christianity to Africa.

The significant value of African women's productive labour in producing and processing food created and maintained their rights in domestic, political, cultural, economic, religious and social spheres, among others.",Agri

🔥AI Ville is an AI-driven virtual society where intelligent agents live, trade, farm, and evolve autonomously. It features a decentralized economy, AI governance, and dynamic social interactions, creating a self-sustaining digital ecosystem. Players and AI co-exist, cultivating the future of AI-powered communities in a Web3 world.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the gaming industry, transitioning from simple NPC scripting to the introduction of intelligent AI agents. We are moving towards a new era of virtual societies, where AI agents are not just executing predefined tasks but learning, reasoning, adapting, and engaging in real-world interactions. In AI Ville, each AI agent possesses:

🔥An Independent Cognitive System: AI characters can perceive the environment, remember past experiences, and apply these memories to future decisions.
 
🔥Dynamic Behavioral Logic: AI characters can adjust plans, formulate strategies, and even influence the entire virtual society based on changes in their surroundings.
 
🔥Real Social Relationships: AI characters can develop friendships, engage in competition, and collaborate, influencing the game economy, market transactions, and community governance.

👉In AI Ville, AI agents are not just background elements of the game world; they are independent social members with their own goals, personalities, and ability to evolve, co-creating the game world alongside human players.

🔥AI Ville’s Goal: Building a Dynamic AI Virtual World
AI Ville aims to build a truly interactive AI society, where AI agents are not just background NPCs but co-creators of the world alongside players. Key features of AI Ville:

🔥Decentralized Social Interactions: AI agents do not follow predefined scripts but form dynamic social networks based on memory, reasoning, and interaction.
 
🔥Economic Autonomy: AI agents can independently run farms, establish shops, and invest in markets, forming a realistic economic system.
 
🔥Player-AI Co-Governance: AI agents and players can hold governance tokens (AGT), jointly voting on world rules, such as adjusting market tax rates or opening new trade areas.

In AI Ville, players are not just participants; they are social builders who can influence world rules, adjust economic policies, and shape the growth of AI agents. AI agents, in turn, will self-learn and evolve, gradually constructing a more intelligent social system.

👀 So far I'm playing the game myself since I was guest in the AMA 2-3 weeks back and I can tell you it's really good one and I'm super impressed from it. And the best part you can earn rewards while you are playing 🔥

2025-04-03 20:50:35+00:00,"CHEAP IMPORTS - Fascinating (probably only to a few)

One of the hidden details on the Tariff announcement is stopping Duty free ""de minimus"" shipping from ALL countries as soon as the systems are ready.

Why is this so interesting? Well …

Trump is closing tax loopholes that let Chinese giants like Temu and Shien flood their markets with cheap, duty-free imports by selling directly to the consumer under a certain price point. The biggest platform for cheap Chinese imports is Amazon. These products undercut genuine stock holding businesses in the US and the U.K. 

What it means is that businesses have far higher costs and cannot compete with these cheap Chinese sellers supplying directly to the consumer.

The UK could do the same to help British businesses compete—but instead, it treats companies like shien like VIPs while ignoring the genuine complaints of businesses.

If the government had any semblance of business understanding at all it would want to help British businesses compete by doing the same thing! 

Instead it’s going to slap a carbon tax on business importers and continue to allow these direct to consumer transactions because they are “too hard to track” (which is bollocks)

I appreciate most of you will find this very boring. But when British businesses keep collapsing, don’t say you weren’t warned.",Agri

Guo Jiakun: The U.S. announced tariff hikes on imports from many countries, including China, under the pretext of reciprocity. This gravely violates WTO rules, and undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system. China firmly rejects this and will do what is necessary to defend our legitimate rights and interests.

In the Budget 2025, FM Nirmala Sitharaman had announced a scheme to establish India as a global toy hub through cluster development, focusing on skills and a manufacturing ecosystem for high quality, 'Made in India' toys. This aims to reduce India's reliance on toy imports, particularly from China, which accounted for 76% of imports over the past decade. 

Notably, India's toy imports from China significantly decreased from $214 million in FY13 to $41.6 million in FY24, causing China's share in India's toy imports to drop from 94% to 64%, indicating improved domestic competitiveness.",Agri

A wonderful post from facebook.
Tom Marland is very, very smart!

“There are worse things than a tariff”
Donald J Trump became a one man economic wrecking ball this week slapping pretty much everything and everyone with a tariff.
He has single handedly wiped trillions off the international stock market, isolated the US from every trading partner and has basically declared a trade war with China.
Australia didn’t miss out and has coped a 10% across the board tariff/tax/ US- GST on the $22 billion worth of goods we ship over from the colony each year.
The $2.2 billion clip will hurt - but it could have been worse.
I watched on in horror when Trump specifically mentioned the Australian “ban” on US beef and that he was going to do the same to Australian beef “as of mid night tonight”…
Fortunately who ever is advising Trump and thought that wonderful “Tariff board” was a good idea knows that there is no such thing as an Australian ban on US beef and as a result of the AUSFTA - the US can sell what ever they want into Australia for free.
There was a ban placed on fresh US meat into Australia in 2004 due to an outbreak of mad cows disease. This was lifted in 2019 but with tight biosecurity requirements.
Ironically, the US can bring as much fresh meat into Australia as they want but it must be born and raised in the US. The US has requested that they be allowed to also use cattle sourced from Mexico and Canada but grain fed in the US.
If the Donald is so pro-American goods - this restriction shouldn’t be a problem.
The reality is - why would an American beef producer want to sell meat into Australia for $6AUS a kilo when they can get $12US at home is probably why we aren’t getting swamped with Texas Longhorns.
But despite all the rhetoric and tough talk - Trump isn’t being a pain in the proverbial for fun.
The reality is much more frightening.
The US has a domestic debt of $36 trillion dollars (US).
Thats $36,000,000,000,000.
This is 125% of their annual GDP.
This debt is growing by $3.6 trillion per year.
Their interest payments have just cracked $1 trillion per year.
To put that in context - Australia’s entire annual GDP is $1.8 trillion.
America, like most western economies, have spent a lot of money over the last 40 years on things that not only don’t make any money but cost more money in a never ending money losing cycle.
In 1984 - the US debt was $1.6 trillion - roughly 40% of GDP.
Things like fighting unwinnable wars haven’t helped but the main burden is rising social welfare, medical and federal agency costs.
Elon Musks brain child - DOGE - has slashed and burned through $100 billion in savings in a few months but this only scratches the surface of the world largest economy which is on a debt death spiral.
America now has the largest external debt than any other economy in the world.
As much as Trump likes to claim he is running some ideological crusade against everything woke and wanting to Make America Great Again - the reality is the US is running out of money.
Trumps tariffs will raise $700 billion a year.
He could have made this through raising taxes or slashing government services - but he has decided to play an international game of economic brinkmanship and push the pain onto everyone else.
From an Australian context - we - like most south East Asian counties rely solely on the US for our national defence.
Without the US - China could just wander down the South East Asian peninsular picking daisies and jump the ditch into Australia with little resistance other than Bob Katter with an air rifle and a few crocodiles.
The US is at least making China do the honourable thing and buy us out slowly.
But if they grow impatient - the only thing between us and speaking Mandarin - is Donald Trump.
He won’t be much use if the US is broke.
Our illustrious caretaker PM - Anthony “two tone” Albanese - could have seen the tariffs for what they are - an economic reality.
Or at least a chance for the US to have a bit of extra walk around money in the off chance China wants to make Australia its new southern province.
Instead the peanut comes out and says it’s “not the act of a friend”.
Unfortunately, Two Tone’s economic acumen is limited to the 6 months he spent as a bank teller.
His political acumen is blunted from being a life time career politician who is good at spending other peoples money without worrying about the return on investment.
Defence - let’s just hope he never has to lead us into battle.
He could have sent in his main man in the US - Chairman Kevin 07 to sort the Donald out….actually thank god he didn’t otherwise we would have been slapped even harder.
The new tariffs are really a side show to the real bullet (excuse the pun) Australia needs to bite under our AUKUS obligations.
Australia spends approximately 2% of our GDP on defence spending - or $50 billion a year.
The US spends 3.5% of its GDP - about $3 trillion - to gear up to save everyone else’s bacon.
The Donald wants its strategic partners to match them - so Australia has to find another $75 billion a year or start training some crocodiles or god forbid - give Bob Katter something bigger than a .22…..
Australia could set up a DOGE and find that money in the same time Gout Gout runs the 100.
The NDIS - now supporting 700,000 people and costing $50 billion a year would be a start. The NDIS now costs 150% more than Medicare - that looks after 95% of the population.
15% of boys in Australia aged 5 to 7 are now on the NDIS for behaviour management issues.
Just crack off the Ritalin bill and give a few more boots up the arse and you'd save half.
We spend about $250 billion a year in public sector wages that employs 2.5 million people. If you aren’t a nurse, teacher, policeman or doing something useful other than annoying people trying to do their actual jobs - you’re out.
We spend $200 billion on social security and welfare payments per year. Unless you have no legs and no arms or don't have a heart beat - back to work.
I’d estimate that there would be $500 billion a year lost in productivity in Australia just from trying to make the whole continent a national park.
We shut down fisheries, we shut down forestry, we shut down primary industry, we shut down any use of our natural resources - because we think we are rich.
We then import the same shit from poor countries and think we are saving the world.
The gravy train is over - unless you want to take your chances trying to learn Mandarin - Australia has to remove its head from its proverbial.
Don’t worry about cost of living pressures.
Don’t worry about housing shortages.
Don’t worry about Tariffs.
Don’t even worry about climate change - China clearly doesn’t.
If you think life’s tough in Australia now - there are 1.2 billion people fluent in Mandarin that would take your spot in a heart beat - and can.
And will - unless we start now.",Agri

1. Food Costs Go Up

That 10% blanket tariff? It hits imported staples: coffee, spices, oils, seafood, produce.

Distributors pass that cost down fast.

Suddenly, ingredient prices are up 15–20% overnight.

2. Equipment & Supplies? More Expensive Too

Plates, fridges, ovens, cleaning supplies many are imported.
Replacing a broken freezer now costs hundreds more.

3. Can’t Just Raise Prices

Loyal customers are price-sensitive.
Raise menu prices too much? You lose regulars.
Don’t raise them? You eat the cost. Either way = margin squeeze.

4. Staff Takes the Hit

With profits down, hours get cut. Raises postponed.
Benefits dropped. Eventually… layoffs.
And these are local jobs, not corporate cuts.

5. No Safety Net

Big chains can absorb shocks.
A small restaurant? One bad month from disaster.
Add high-interest debt, inflation, and softening demand…

And yes,closing the doors is on the table.

This isn’t just about foreign policy. It’s about your neighborhood businesses.

Here’s how it worked. Or more accurately, how it didn’t work—until it did.

Step one: Tariffs. Always start with a punch. Something loud. Visible. Crude. Like a guy flipping a table in a negotiation just to let everyone know he’s serious. Slap a tariff on steel, on soybeans, on semiconductors—hell, on pencils if you want. The specifics don’t matter. The message does.

Step two: Dangle the Deal. Pull the opposition in close. Smile across the table. Maybe even leak a draft agreement or two. Let the markets breathe. Let the headlines spin up hope. ""Progress,"" they’ll say. “Breakthrough.” Everyone wants to believe the nightmare is almost over.

Step three: Pull the Rug. Just as hope starts peeking over the horizon—boom—another round of escalation. More tariffs. New sanctions. A tweetstorm at midnight. Justified, of course, because they didn’t give us the deal we wanted. Classic carrot, then stick. Then another stick.

Step four: Repeat Until Breakage. Lather. Rinse. Sanction. Repeat. The goal isn’t to make a deal—it’s to grind the other side down. Force a blink. Or, if not, wait for your own economy to start coughing blood. Whichever comes first.

Step five: The Final Deal. When the other side finally bends—or when the domestic pain becomes too loud to ignore—you swoop in with the resolution. Declare victory. Shake hands. Hold a press conference. And if anyone remembers the months of chaos and whiplash, just remind them: this is what tough looks like.

It wasn’t diplomacy. It was dealmaking by attrition. Weaponized optimism, timed despair. And somehow, it worked—just not for who you’d expect.",Agri
2025-04-07 17:08:51+00:00,"How Market Turmoil Could Sweeten Chocolate Prices

""In an ironic twist, Donald Trump’s latest tariff tantrum may be doing what no chocolatier could — making cocoa cheaper, one trade shock at a time.""

As Easter approaches, many consumers are facing sticker shock at the chocolate aisle. Based on recent data, the price of Easter-related chocolate products has risen between 10% and 25% over the past two years — a spike driven not just by inflation, but also by “shrinkflation,” the practice of downsizing portions while maintaining, or even raising, prices.

At the heart of this phenomenon lies cocoa, the raw commodity essential to chocolate production. Since October 2022, cocoa prices have surged from roughly $2,000 USD per metric ton to over $12,475 USD by last December — an increase of about 280% in just three years. This steep and sometimes volatile climb is the result of a combination of climate and structural shocks.

Last #Easter, several major players — including multinationals like Mars, Nestlé, and Mondelez — were able to absorb some of the price pressures through forward contracts and strategic inventories. This year, however, those buffers are virtually depleted. Across the supply chain, from global food giants to artisanal chocolatiers, all are now facing cocoa costs four to five times higher than they were in 2022.

Several factors are driving this crisis. Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana — which together account for over 60% of global cocoa output — are grappling with an unprecedented set of challenges. Droughts, floods, the spread of the swollen shoot virus, aging plantations, and chronically low farmgate prices are all threatening the long-term viability of cocoa production in these countries. As a result, global supply is increasingly constrained.

Meanwhile, demand remains resilient. In many Asian countries, a growing middle class continues to boost chocolate consumption. According to the latest figures from Mordor Intelligence, Canada ranks 11th in the world for per capita chocolate consumption, averaging 6.4 kg per person annually. Switzerland, Germany, and Ireland remain the leaders, each averaging more than 8 kg per person.

It’s worth noting that milk chocolate — particularly popular during the Easter season — has been slightly less impacted by soaring cocoa prices, due to its lower cocoa content compared to dark chocolate. Still, the effect is far from negligible, as even low-cocoa-content products are under inflationary pressure.
Interestingly, some recent relief in cocoa prices may be tied to market turmoil sparked by geopolitical uncertainty — particularly the re-emergence of Donald Trump on the U.S. political stage. Fears of trade wars, tariffs, and a global economic slowdown have unsettled commodity markets, causing cocoa prices to drop by 37% since December. Ironically, while this political uncertainty adds volatility to financial markets, it may end up making chocolate slightly more affordable in the months to come.

Despite all this, households are still expected to include chocolate in their Easter celebrations — if only to preserve tradition. That said, the composition of Easter baskets may shift: more candy like licorice, a bit less chocolate… and maybe even a pair of socks.",Agri

Storm vaults already offer 10–25% APR from trading activity, fees, and liquidations

FIVA takes it further by letting users lock in fixed returns, access yield upfront, or farm with leveraged exposure — all without liquidation risk

With FIVA, Storm LPs can tokenize positions, split principal and yield, and boost rewards through optimized strategies

It’s flexible, efficient, and built with layered protection to keep yields stable even when markets aren’t

He added that the ""trade balance is abstract"" but the price of eggs is concrete"" and he was just getting started...

""Here's what I see. I see a lot of uncertainty and I think to some extent it's intentional,"" Kennedy said on CNN.

""If you listen to the president's aides weekend before last and then listen to them this weekend, you don't have to be Einstein's cousin to figure out they were saying things that were inconsistent,"" he continued.

""Now that raises one of two possibilities to me. Either it's intentional or these folks aren't competent to manage a food truck,"" he went on. 

""Now I know them, they're intelligent people whether you agree with them or not so I think the administration for whatever reason is obfuscating a little bit,"" added Kennedy.

""Maybe it's part of the president's negotiating strategy. I just don't know. I do know this, tariffs are important but so are high prices,"" said Kennedy. ""The trade balance is abstract. The price of eggs is concrete.""

He then pivoted to hitting a bunch of right-wing talking points—

""And we need to be spending a lot of time on reconciliation, redesigning the tax code, deregulating the economy, reducing spending to get prices down,"" he said. ""That is at least as important as tariffs in my opinion.""

Of course, the real way to get prices down is to simply remove the MAGA tariffs. They are choking our economy and destabilizing global markets. We gain nothing from them.

2025-04-18 08:12:45+00:00,"E-Commerce Boom in India’s Startup Ecosystem

The trade war’s ripple effects are directly boosting Indian e-commerce exporters. The U.S. recently ended duty-free treatment (the “de minimis” rule) for low-value packages from China and Hong Kong, effective May 2 . This policy shift suddenly gives Indian e-commerce sellers a big edge . A report by the Global Trade Research Initiative highlights that Chinese firms shipped about $46 billion worth of small-value goods to U.S. consumers in 2024 under that now-closed duty-free loophole . With China effectively shut out of this segment by tariffs, a huge market gap has opened for alternate suppliers. India is primed to fill that void – it already has over 100,000 online sellers and about $5 billion in current cross-border e-commerce exports, focusing on customized niches like handicrafts, fashion, and home goods . Indian small businesses can now compete more effectively in the U.S. market, offering their products without the punitive duties that hobble their Chinese counterparts .

This unfolding e-commerce boom is fostering optimism in India’s startup ecosystem. Global investors are taking note: many see India as the next hub for growth in a de-globalizing world. In fact, India’s government is actively supporting this trend – launching a new trade helpdesk on April 11 to assist exporters and MSMEs in navigating the evolving tariff landscape . Venture capital and foreign investments are also eyeing India’s digital commerce space with renewed interest. As prominent investor-author Ruchir Sharma observed this week, India could be one of the surprise beneficiaries of the U.S. tariff push, with foreign capital flowing back in as global supply chains rebalance. What hurts the American economy “might help others,” Sharma noted, predicting emerging markets like India will attract more investment even as the U.S. cools .

Overall, the mood is optimistic. India’s nimble entrepreneurs and robust startup ecosystem are turning global headwinds into tailwinds. Global trade realignments are translating into an e-commerce boom on Indian soil. From local artisans selling overseas via online marketplaces, to unicorn startups expanding logistics and fulfillment, the entire value chain stands to gain. U.S. tariffs, in an ironic twist, are accelerating India’s integration into global commerce. The coming months could see India cement its place as a “China+1” supply chain hub – fueling growth, innovation, and investor confidence across the India startup ecosystem.",Agri

The exemption allows packages valued under $800 to enter the United States duty free, following the idea that the government shouldn’t spend more money trying to collect a tariff than would otherwise be collected.

The vast majority of packages entering the U.S. under this exemption come from China, and it has allowed huge growth among Chinese e-commerce companies that ship low cost goods directly to American consumers from China.

But, as part of an escalating trade war with China, President Trump signed an executive order ending the de minimis exemption starting May 2nd, specifically on packages from China and Hong Kong.

‘GO BIG OR GET OUT’
‘WE’LL FINE YOU IF YOU’RE TOO SMALL’
‘YES, BUT IMPORTS ARE CHEAPER’
‘MILK’S MILK’
‘IT’S WHITE STUFF’

30,000 dairy farms have closed since 1986; and with the news this week it’s easy to see why.

Our farmers are being squeezed out over and over again - with serious lack of investment in our industry to show consumers the value of natures original superfood biting back again and again.

Extreme vegan pages are claiming it’s a ‘victory’ that less farms exists - yet don’t realise the farms left simply get bigger and bigger.

This week, dozens of farms in Northern England and southern Scotland face drastic price cuts; or worse, having to dump their milk due to ‘market pressures’ and equipment breakdowns.

The reason, is that this time of year is ‘spring flush’ - with the highest volumes of milk in the year due to cows going outside to grass after winter, and a flurry of new calves arriving.  It happens every single year, without fail, and everyone in our industry is fully aware of it.  So why has it caught them out?

We know the answer - a failure from top to bottom in our industry; a lack of respect for the superfood that is dairy, and a supermarket culture that wants homogeneous products with unemotional labelling and as little traceability as they can manage to ensure they pay the lowest price possible, to make the highest profit imaginable 

That’s why we only work with small scale family farms, it’s why we only offer organic and it’s why we exist - to stop the madness one reusable bottle at a time 💪",Agri

TL;DR - @arkham is a free wallet & token tracking platform where trading volume guarantees you're farming a solid airdrop. if you trade - you need to check it out.  

back before 2025 hit - when no one expected presidential meme coins to drain the market - the community was starving for any kind of meaningful drops. fomo after the big ones like @movementlabsxyz (~$5k if you did all the tasks) and @vana (gave out up to $20k to active users) was at an all-time high.  

that’s when people (me included) discovered a new wave - perp-dexes. you trade on the dex, and get rewarded with airdrops based on your buy/sell volume. dream setup, right?  

gotta give props - arkham proved the doubters wrong.  
for $500k in volume you could get ~$1.7k in $ARKM, and if you were in season 1 - +50% bonus on top.  

what matters most though - arkham is actually useful. i use it myself to track wallets and token stats.  

you literally get free access to a tool where you can monitor every move a token has made, even visualize it all with bubble maps.  

imo, you’re not just picking up a daily-use alpha tool - you’re also farming another drop on the side, 'cause season 2 is still running. level up your trading and get rewarded for it.

If you’re still relying on one warehouse, one fulfillment model, or one country, consider this your wake-up call.

Key Takeaways:

• Tariff shifts and de minimis changes are disrupting the global cost structure for e-commerce brands.

• Brands overly reliant on Chinese imports or DTC fulfillment models are the most exposed.

• U.S. regulatory changes are pushing a long-term shift toward nearshoring and diversified supply chains.

• Fulfillment strategy must align with evolving trade rules to remain sustainable.

• Strategic investments now will separate the survivors from the reactive.

2025-04-24 11:33:13+00:00,"Nestle, Unilever Ease US Price Hikes on Food, Basics | Newsmax Money

Household goods and packaged food makers are easing U.S. price increases to avoid losing American shoppers to retailers' less expensive private-label brands as a global trade war tests the limits of their pricing power at grocery stores.

U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed broad tariffs on several countries around the world in recent months, sparking worries that the U.S. economy will be pushed into recession, with commodities and basic utilities becoming more expensive.

Trump met with major retailers, including Walmart and Target on Monday to discuss the tariffs' impact on their imports.

""Some political decisions, economic decisions taken have rather undermined already soft consumer confidence,"" Nestle CEO Laurent Freixe told journalists Thursday during an earnings call. Nestle, the world's biggest packaged food company and maker of Nescafe and Kit-Kat, cut prices in the United States, its biggest market, by 1%.

""When it comes to pricing, we have to take into account the customers, the consumers, competitors' moves,"" Freixe said. ""We are trying to take as much price as we can to cover our costs while being mindful of the consumer response.""

Dove soap maker Unilever, which also reported earnings on Thursday, noted ""declining consumer sentiment"" in North America, where it raised prices by only 2.1%.

Nestle, Unilever and other makers of household products and packaged food need to show caution with price hikes to avoid alienating American shoppers who are worried about having less money to spend on groceries, industry consultants and investors said.

In grocery stores, these companies compete head-to-head with retailers' private-label products, which are generally lower priced.

PRIVATE-LABEL SALES SOAR

""Consumer confidence is down. We can see consumption patterns are changing, and it will remain competitive,"" Kris Licht, CEO of Reckitt, said on an earnings call Wednesday. He added that, in that context, the maker of Durex condoms in the first quarter raised prices by just 0.9% in North America compared to 3% in Europe and 3.9% in emerging markets.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, consumer goods firms lost market share to store brands made by retailers like Walmart and Target.

Rob Holston, EY's global and America's consumer products sector leader, said consumer companies selling major brands of everyday products had raised prices as much as they can in recent years.

""There's a large percentage of people that will just move into private label"" options, Holston said, adding that his consumer goods clients have said they're on ""war-footing"" with private label brands now.

Data pulled for Reuters by research firm Nielsen IQ showed that as recently as in the first quarter, makers of major household goods brands on average kept price increases roughly flat at 2% when compared with faster price hikes of about 4% from private label brands for the same basket of goods that included categories from coffee and soap to baby food and tampons.

Private-label goods are still cheaper on average by at least roughly $1, according to the NielsenIQ data. The U.S. Consumer Price Index increased 2.4% in March on a year-on-year basis, above the 2% rate at which big brands were recently raising prices, according to the NielsenIQ data.

McKinsey partner Patricio Ibáñez said shoppers are bracing for costs to rise because of tariffs, and a survey led by the consulting firm showed 60% of people plan to shift their consumption habits by buying things that are cheaper or by switching to wholesale clubs or going to online retailers.

""We wouldn't recommend price increases,"" Ibáñez said. ""Private brands are growing four times faster than national (big) brands in the U.S.""

'HIDING PLACES'

This trend is worrying for investors in major consumer goods companies like Nestle, even though most of the firms insist their operations aren't significantly exposed to tariffs.

""It's very difficult to find hiding places for investors,"" said Tom Lemaigre, a portfolio manager on the European equities team at investor Janus Henderson. Lemaigre said shoppers are thinking carefully about how they spend their money and that consumer goods companies need to figure out how to combat competition from private label brands.

On https://t.co/eaJ38NuQUc, shoppers can buy a 100-fluid-ounce bottle of Unilever's Persil liquid laundry detergent for $12.97. For $11.64, however, shoppers can buy a 154-fluid-ounce bottle of Walmart's Great Value detergent which promises 154 loads of laundry.

2025-04-24 11:57:15+00:00,"Spain leads in Ukrainian wheat imports this season, but tariff clouds loom over 2025/26 - ASAP Agri

Christina Serebriakova, CEO of ASAP Agri and Broker at Atria Brokers, participated in the Andalusian Commodity Exchange held on 24 April in Seville, Spain — one of Europe’s most influential private gatherings for the agricultural commodities sector.

During meetings with traders, industrial buyers, multinationals, and fellow brokers, Serebriakova discussed Spain’s critical role in Ukrainian agricultural exports and how that role could shift in the upcoming marketing season. She highlighted that, despite changes in Spain’s feed compound formulas in favor of soybean meal, Ukraine managed to export over 3 MMT of wheat to the country in the current season, mostly feed-grade, allowing Spain to retain its status as Ukraine’s top wheat buyer.

However, this leadership position may not hold next season. With the European Union’s suspension of tariffs and quotas on Ukrainian agricultural exports set to expire on 5 June 2025, new trade restrictions are expected. According to ASAP Agri's insider sources, the European Commission plans to introduce a 1 MMT wheat import quota starting 6 June, with volumes beyond that subject to a €95/MT duty. This policy shift could significantly impact Ukraine’s wheat competitiveness in Spain.

On a more positive note, prospects for Ukrainian corn exports to Spain remain solid, as the country continues to be a key destination — with no quotas or tariffs on the table for now.

🇪🇸 Ukrainian exports to Spain (July 2024 – March 2025)

🔸Wheat: 3.1MMT (24% of Ukraine’s total wheat exports) — 1st largest importer
🔹Corn: 2.6 MMT (15%) — 3rd largest importer
🔸Barley: 188 KMT (9%) — 3rd largest importer
🔹Sunflower oil (Sep–Mar): 378 KMT (13%) — 2nd largest importer

If you’re still paying 5bps per trade or watching 1 in 3 orders fail, it’s time to upgrade. Deriverse is a decentralized, next-gen trading platform built specifically for market makers and pro takers — not just another copy-paste DEX.

Everything about Deriverse is optimized for performance:
•Fees that make sense – With prepaid subscriptions, taker fees drop to just 0.5bps — up to 75% cheaper than what most Solana DEXs charge.
•Maximum efficiency – Trades on Deriverse use only 5k–20k compute units, compared to 130k+ on competitors. That means lower costs and faster confirmations.
•Real reliability – Built for scale with 5,000+ trades/day, Deriverse has a dramatically lower failure rate compared to the 35% average across Solana.

And yes — it’s fully decentralized. No compromises on trust, speed, or execution.

Deriverse isn’t just better — it’s built for the pros.
If you’re serious about trading on Solana, this is the platform to watch.

This town is the Tilapia capital of China, exporting Tilapia from a farm 1.5 times the size of San Francisco to the U.S. 

However, tariffs have severely impacted the export market and created a cascading effect within China:

1. Fish exports have declined.
2. This decline has led to a decrease in the sale of fish fry.
3. Consequently, the sale of fish feed for the fry has also fallen.
4. As a result, the consumption of corn and soy used in fish feed has decreased.

The Chinese industry cannot replace the U.S. market for Tilapia, as it is their largest market. China is the world's largest exporter of freshwater tilapia, controlling 57% of global tilapia exports.

So, can the U.S. replace Chinese suppliers? 

Indonesia, Egypt, Vietnam, and Brazil are the largest tilapia exporters outside of China.

This poses a risk for China, as retailers like Walmart may seek alternative suppliers permanently in Indonesia and Egypt. 

This is the reality of the situation. Consumers can more easily seek new suppliers for elastic products with substitutes than suppliers can seek new customers.

Time is not on China's side; if they cannot replace tilapia exports with local consumption, they will remain vulnerable to trade wars.",Agri

America exports clean versions of its foods to other countries, but feeds its citizens the toxic versions. Why? They have the clean versions. 

America has a Constitution where speaking out is protected by the very First Amendment. It was so important to those who knew and had experienced tyranny that it was the first item to be written. 
America is heavily armed, and the Second Amendment protects this. (However, more than half of American gun stats listed as ""crimes"" are actually suicides.)
America has resources. Gas, oil, lumber, lithium, steel, quartz, clean water, land, and more. 

Being as though America is protected with speaking out and being armed, and we've seen a huge movement with every other country disarming their citizens and using laws to silence them and punish dissent, a globalized world *could* have a vested interest in assuring this country's destruction.  It could be through drugs, tainted processed food, disease, laws restricting gardens/raising hens/watering, going after farmers, geoengineering/weather, online propaganda, financial destruction, unvetted open borders, debt, glamorizing being childless, fear mongering, creating more isolation/mental health issues, pushing labels as our identity, attempts to dismantle the family, divide people/isolate and more. They could be sponsoring politicians, bills, laws, or creating global nonsense based on sponsored ""science"" (again) upon which to tax or restrict us-or both.

2025-05-01 09:19:24+00:00,"Meanwhile in Solana core land…
While CT was busy building GPT agents that YOLO trade and farming engagement points, Solana tried to quietly flip the tokenomics meta.

It almost worked.

The underhyped story of SIMD-123, SIMD-228, and why validator politics might be Solana's spiciest drama.

Act I: The good, the fee, and the ugly.
Early 2025, two governance proposals hit the chain:

SIMD-123: Let validators share tx fees with stakers (finally).

SIMD-228: Cut inflation from 4.5% to 0.87% (basically a halving, but spicier).

Both were protocol-level upgrades. Both had economic implications. Only one survived.

SIMD-123: Fee-sharing for the people.
This one passed. And yeah, it's a big deal.

For the first time, validators can share transaction fees with delegators on-chain. No off-chain accounting. No spreadsheets in Telegram.

This means:

Staking is now juiced with real usage-based rewards (not just inflation).

Validators compete with real economics (set-your-own commission vibes).

More incentive alignment equals better UX for stakers.

It passed with ~75% support. Almost no one opposed it. Feels like the network finally caught up to Jito vibes.

SIMD-228: The inflation flippening that wasn't.
This one almost broke Crypto Twitter if anyone had noticed.

SIMD-228 wanted to:

Scrap the 4.5% fixed inflation.

Move to a ""smart emissions"" model.

Scale inflation based on staking participation.

In short: Stop overpaying for security no one's asking for.

Backers included big brains like Anatoly and Burniske.
Result: 61.4% yes. Not enough. Didn't pass.

Why it failed: Validator hunger games.
Turns out, dropping rewards from ~5% APY to ~1.5% sounds nice —
Unless you're a small validator with razor-thin margins.

SIMD-228 would've slashed protocol issuance. Good for tokenomics. Bad for validators who survive on inflation and charge 0% commission to stay competitive.

It split the validator set:

Big guys wanted lower inflation for long-term health.

Small guys said ""pls we need to eat"".

And the small guys won. By just 5%.

Record turnout. Zero headlines.
74% of staked SOL voted. The highest in Solana history. That's more than the US presidential election turnout.

910 validators showed up to vote. The result:

SIMD-123: Approved.

SIMD-228: Rejected.

Solana: Officially governed by humans, not vibes.

Governance maturity is real. But so is the political tension.

Why this matters.
With SIMD-123, Solana just made staking better.

This is huge:

It rewards actual usage, not just emissions.

Aligns stakers with network activity.

Makes the protocol more sustainable.

Think of it like ETH tips but on steroids.
And unlike Ethereum, you don't need to build a staking dashboard in Rust just to track it.

What SIMD-228 almost unlocked.
If it had passed:

Inflation drops to under 1 percent.

SOL supply tightens.

Stakers earn less, but SOL holders win long-term.

Call it the ultrasound money arc nobody expected from Solana.

But the network blinked. Not because the logic was wrong — because the timing was.

The hidden unlock: Solana's social layer.
What this whole saga showed: Solana's governance actually works.

It's not LARPing.

People showed up. Validators debated. Helius ran analysis. SolanaCompass posted turnout charts. CT lurked silently.

You might not care about protocol politics.
But they're what separate real chains from L2 flavor-of-the-week.

Ok so what now?
SIMD-123 kicks in. Staking gets sweeter.
SIMD-228 might return. But phased, gentler, maybe with validator subsidies baked in.

And governance on Solana just got a lot more interesting.

This isn't just throughput and TPS anymore.
It's economics. It's politics. It's a validator civil war with yield on the line.

Final boss level: Underrated Solana arc.
While everyone's playing attention games, Solana is quietly rewriting the base layer economics.

The next few months:

Firedancer gets closer to mainnet.

Helius and RPC heads decouple read-write infra.

SIMD-228 comes back… stronger?

If you're fading Solana because you think it's old news,
You might miss the part where it becomes the most performant and economically sustainable L1 out there.

👉🏼 Trade Ban & Port Closure

India has fully banned imports from Pakistan, including indirect trade. While direct imports were just ₹25 crore last year, Wagah border trade was over ₹3,800 crore. The ban also halts informal trade and blocks Indian ports for Pakistani vessels, hurting Pakistan’s small traders.

👉🏼 Airspace Closure Adds Losses

India has shut its airspace to Pakistani aircraft, forcing rerouting via China—raising fuel costs and delays. European airlines are also avoiding Pakistani airspace, further straining its aviation sector.

👉🏼 Indus Waters Treaty Suspended

India has susp*nded the Indus Waters Treaty, affecting rivers vital to over 150 million Pakistanis. This raises fears of water scarcity and economic disruption.

👉🏼 IMF Loan Under Scrutiny

India has asked the IMF to review its $7 billion bailout and $1.3 billion climate loan to Pakistan. While India can’t block the aid, it may influence global opinion and complicate Pakistan’s recovery efforts.

👉🏼 Tensions High

Pakistan test-fired a ballistic missile, signaling military readiness. With both sides on edge, the coming days will test diplomatic resilience and regional peace.

India’s firm, multi-pronged response shows it’s ready to counter cross-border terror!sm with strategic pressure.

Chinese retailer Temu has shifted strategy in the face of U.S. tariffs.

Through executive order, President Donald Trump has ended the so-called de minimis rule, which allowed goods worth $800 or less to enter the country without tariffs. He’s also increasing tariffs on Chinese goods by more than 100%, forcing both Chinese companies like Shein and American giants like Amazon to adjust plans and hike prices.

CNBC reports that Temu was affected as well, with U.S. shoppers seeing “import charges” between 130% and 150% added to their bills. Now, however, the company is no longer shipping goods directly from China to the United States. Instead, it only displays listings for products available in U.S. warehouses, while goods shipped from China are listed as out of stock.

“Temu’s pricing for U.S. consumers remains unchanged as the platform transitions to a local fulfillment model,” a Temu spokesperson said in a statement. “All sales in the U.S. are now handled by locally based sellers, with orders fulfilled from within the country.”

2025-05-10 07:45:01+00:00,"Copied from ""Sam's Hens""

A very sad day for British farming as the new US trade deal has opened the door to American imports of beef and ‘other’ agricultural products. 

US farmers are often businesses operated over 1000’s of acres, meaning significant intensification of farming practices and poorer animal welfare standards resulting in economies of scale. On the other hand, most UK farms are family owned, operating over a couple of hundred acres most of the time with some of the highest animal health and welfare standards in the world. 

The new trade deal will mean American beef and (potentially chicken and egg products in the future) will eventually end up on our plates, probably through the wholesale food sector, undercutting high quality British family farmed produce. British consumers will be eating US beef and other agricultural products unknowingly, as it eventually ends up in the food service sector. 

British farmers need the public support more than ever, please #supportlocal or #buybritish wherever you can. 

#familyfarming #supportlocal #buybritish

- end 

I work within the agricultural industry, here are my views. 

This also means we could potentially be eating meat that contains numerous chemicals, vaccines, toxins and additives. Many of you will already know, a lot of these supplements can cause life threatening illnesses. America are well known for their intensified farming methods, their animal welfare standards are not as strict as ours. You only have to watch the documentaries to learn how abhorrent it is. 

It would explain why beef prices at UK market has reached an all time high. The objective was to force beef/cattle farmers to sell off their herds. One local farmer in Dorset received over £1m for selling off his herd at record prices. At up to £7.40 per kg, an organic fed cow could fetch as much as £6000.

This is important to note: because the likes of Bayer (Monsanto) don't make money from organic beef, neither do the big UK animal Pharma organisations like Zoetis when farmers raise organic beef. 

With the supply of British reared beef in demand, you'd think this was all by design, a deliberate act to destroy British Farming. At this point in time, there seems no other explanation.

British farming is being attacked at every conceivable angle. Labour's solution is not to provide a strategy for UK farmers to improve the agri economy, but instead provide a solution by creating trade deals from abroad, this only damages the UK farming industry, whilst labour's investors, and associates get richer through trade deals, and the farming industry collapses.

It is without any doubt, the independent agri economy is being sabotaged by our own government, imported beef will contain a slurry of GMO, vaccined and chemicalised meat. Even the egg industry is being targeted, again, buying this produce off the shelf from a supermarket means you'll have no idea what safety concerns or potentially fatal outcomes this has on our health, our children's health.

Buy British. It's the only way. Support farmers, even if it's once a week, it'll make all the difference. Rural trade has never been so at threat (it is on its knees), if we lose our #farms, we lose good honest workers, we lose jobs, we lose mass areas of land for development. Suicide rates have soared and at the top of the list is #Farmers. Think about that for a second. 

🙏 Praying right now that the good will of the British people can support our farmers. ❤️💪

📉 $123.5B trade surplus with the U.S.
📈 Washington wants retaliation
💥 Hanoi delivers resilience

Key moves:

🌾 1M hectares of low-emission, high-tech rice by 2030
🧠 Digital traceability, smart farming, and climate-proof crops
📦 Cold-chain logistics + deep processing = no more raw export trap

🔁 Stockpiling rice, coffee, pepper to shield farmers from price swings
🛢️ Energy swap: Vietnam signs LNG deals with U.S. firms like GE Vernova to balance trade
💴 Preferential credit, tax deferrals, and VAT refunds for agro-sectors

And the big picture?

🛡️ FTAs like CPTPP and RCEP = escape hatches from Western tariff traps
🧱 New rail links, branded exports, traceability systems = trade credibility
💣 Domestic crackdown on fraud, origin abuse, and price rigging
📢 This isn’t just subsidy. This is state-guided supply chain sovereignty.

In this thread I'll show my favorite strategy I've been running for the past 2 weeks to farm 3 airdrops at the same time: Hyperliquid x DefiApp x Avantis

The strategy is simple you open a long trade on one platform, while shorting the same asset with the same leverage on another platform. This makes you delta-neutral since what you are down in one place you are up on the other. The only cost is paying the fees, which we'll see how to minimize in a minute. We are hoping that the airdrops from these projects > fees spent, which is almost certain imo.

There's a plethora of perp dexes to choose, so why these 3?

1) @HyperliquidX  Need I say more? The points page got an update recently and everything points towards another season (airdrop) incoming. Trading for sure will get some rewards. Hyperliquid is the next Hyperliquid, don't fade them.

2) @defidotapp Instead of launching their own perp dex they were smart and built it on top of Hyperliquid. Right now they don't have any extra fees, so its the same as trading on HL, except that you get XP for their points campaign (for $HOME airdrop).  Just do the trades via their UI. Perps XP takes at most 48hours to be given out, you'll see a chest icon in the UI to claim it once its done.
They have a swaps function too, use them once if you haven't already for another interaction with them. Ah also make sure to join a faction.

3) @avantisfi To be honest, here you can use any perp dex that you like BUT there are some interesting things about Avantis that make it the best for this at the moment.

- Base native -> coinbase listing very likely
- Cool differentiating tech in ZFP (zero-fee perpetuals) where you DON'T PAY fees on losing trades (key for our strategy). Only available for ETH, BTC and SOL.
- Points campaign ENDS IN 3 WEEKS -> I know what you are thinking: ""oh, its too late"". But its not. Hear me out.
They are running x2 XP on all trading pairs for the next 3 weeks. Also they have a weekly trading competition (called Leagues) which awards extra XP based on your ranking. At the end of the week the extra XP is distributed and scores are reset to 0. This pool of extra XP increases week over week.
Week 3 started today (so everyone's score got reset back at 0) and XP pool is 100M (twice as much as week 1). So it actually rewards LATE joiners.
It doesn't matter if you never traded on Avantis, it just makes sense to take advantage of these boosts.
After 3 weeks you can go back to whatever perp dex you were using and you won't have missed a thing. Also competition is low (2k traders only) and ranking up in Leagues is really easy.
This is the formula for their league score system: you get score points based on fees spent and losses.

THE STRATEGY:
Remember that ZFP thing we talked about? This cool tech by Avantis means that when you open a trade you don't pay any opening/closing fees nor funding rate. You pay a small % fee if you profit, and NOTHING if your trade ends up in the negative!
Plus remember that the score formula takes losses into account.
Putting these 2 things together -> what we wanna do is try to do a losing trade on Avantis using ZFP (be sure to toggle this) on ETH or BTC, while doing the opposite trade on DefiApp/HL.
So you think BTC will pump? Go short on Avantis, long on HL.
If you get it right, then you only pay the HL fee (even lower if you stake 10 HYPE) and you get:
- HL points
- DefiApp XP
- Avantis base 2x XP + League score for bonus XP at the end of the week.

If you get it wrong and your Avantis trade goes into profit don't worry, it only means you'll pay an extra fee when closing (which also boosts your score) but the strategy should still be profitable.

One final note, aim to get into the bottom of Diamond and defend the spot until next Monday. Its not worth it to push into higher ranks.
For reference in week 2:
- Highest Sapphire trader (poor soul): score 91 -> bonus 63,675 XP
- Lowest Diamond trader: score 92 -> bonus 162,505 XP (almost 3x the guy beneath)
- Myself in mid Diamond: score 250 -> 196,622.00 XP
- Rank 2 in Diamond: score 2852 -> 213,679.58 XP
As you can see pushing higher for the sake of it isn't worth it, you won't get much extra XP. The biggest bump is making the cut into Diamond.

Risks:
- Avantis does not have cross margin, meaning each trade is isolated, so stick to doing either BTC or ETH, one at a time.
- Markets have been very volatile lately, so use ample margin and
DON'T
GET
LIQUIDATED

Okay that's all for today, thanks for making it until the end. I know this seems intimidating, but if you have never done this type of delta-neutral strategies I really urge you to try it out, as it will keep coming handy in the future. Practice this enough and you will add another tool to your arsenal as a Defi yield farmer.

I think about it as: Primary vs. Secondary.

my primary focus is on the sector of the market where my strengths shine best; that is inherently where I'm going to have more confidence and therefore be able to justify larger risk amounts on 'High-conviction setups'. it's also where a majority of my gains will be made

but this industry is far too lucrative to confine ourselves to one sector of the market

I still want to participate in the airdrops, NFTs, and memes, but I can't justify going too heavy with risk because it's outside my range of skills / knowledge

so I allocate 'gamble bag' position sizes to those secondary plays

eventually what happens is: after a couple years, you've compounded your portfolio so much to the point where your 'degenerate gamble bags' become the same size as what your 'high-conviction plays' were a few years ago

from a linear standpoint, the $ amount of your 'gamble bags' may have increased 10x since then

but from a % standpoint, it remains the same as what it has always been, relative to your portfolio

experiencing this over the past few years has been very vindicating

2025-05-16 14:52:25+00:00,"“With many counter-tariffs gone, it’s time for Ottawa to stop playing politics and start telling Canadians the truth — the tariff narrative no longer matches economic reality.”

Elbows Up, Food Prices Up — Until Ottawa Quietly Backed Down

Bloomberg reported this week that Canada’s food industry is now facing fewer counter-tariffs when importing products from the United States, except for orange juice, coffee and alcohol. For many, this came as a surprise. According to the federal government’s own records, on April 16 — in the middle of the election campaign — Mark Carney, not yet elected, opted to eliminate most of the retaliatory tariffs imposed by his predecessor, Justin Trudeau.

What’s more, the tariff remissions took effect on May 7, the day after Carney’s first official meeting as Prime Minister with President Trump in Washington.

For the food industry and consumers alike, this is welcome news. The “dollar-for-dollar” tariff response that Trudeau championed was always a high-risk strategy against the world’s largest economy. These countermeasures may have fit a political narrative — propping up nationalism under slogans like “Elbows Up” — but they were economically counterproductive. Tariffs on key food ingredients and finished goods raised costs for Canadian importers, manufacturers, and ultimately consumers.

The contrast with the United States is stark. Despite imposing tariffs on food products from Canada, Mexico, and other countries, the U.S. saw food inflation fall to 2.0% in April. In Canada, food inflation continues to rise. Our unemployment rate is ticking upward. The U.S. jobless rate remains stable. The policy gap — and its consequences — are increasingly visible.

Still, the Carney government’s lack of transparency is concerning. On April 10, during the election campaign, Carney briefly paused his campaign to convene a cabinet committee meeting on tariffs. At the time, the move raised eyebrows. Now, it’s clear he was preparing to walk back Ottawa’s retaliatory measures. Yet the public was not informed, at least not openly. No formal announcement was made during the campaign. Voters were left in the dark — arguably to avoid alienating the Elbows Up base.

Good policy? Yes. Transparent leadership? Not quite.

The other concern is how grocers, particularly Loblaw, are handling the tariff conversation. Loblaw has been warning Canadians of an imminent wave of price hikes due to tariffs, marking affected products with a “T” symbol in stores. According to Loblaw’s communications team, the symbol applies only to finished goods still subject to tariffs — items like pasta, rice, soap, and shampoo. About half of these items are food products.

They add that the government’s decision to lift tariffs on U.S. ingredients used in Canadian-made goods — like granola bars — is a relief. Fair enough. But it raises the question: Why continue to escalate public messaging about tariff-related inflation when the federal government is clearly moving away from that approach?

Yes, some retaliatory tariffs remain. But the list is shrinking, not growing. The tone from Ottawa has shifted. And so should the narrative from grocers.

In the U.S., Walmart is echoing similar concerns about price hikes, but that’s a different market with different dynamics. In Canada, where supply chains are already under strain and consumer confidence is fragile, this kind of messaging from industry leaders can easily veer into fear-mongering.

This entire episode — from opaque policymaking in Ottawa to corporate messaging campaigns — has been frustratingly opaque. But with a new government in place, there’s reason to believe that Canada’s approach to trade with the U.S. will be more strategic and less reactive.

What we need now is candour. The Trudeau era of performative economics is over. It’s time for both the Carney government and Canada’s grocers to level with Canadians. The politics of fear and slogans should give way to data, transparency, and a renewed focus on affordability and competitiveness.",Agri

2025-05-20 14:30:23+00:00,"""Canada’s food inflation problem isn’t just imported — it’s engineered. Tariffs, trade missteps, and performative politics have all played a role. It’s time for Ottawa to stop blaming global forces and start owning the domestic decisions driving up our grocery bills.""

How Ottawa Made Your Groceries More Expensive

It was expected, but still jarring. In April, food inflation in Canada surged to 3.8% — a full 2.1 percentage points above the national inflation rate, and nearly double the U.S. rate of 2.0%. Once again, food is the primary driver behind Canada’s headline inflation, amplifying affordability concerns from coast to coast.

Behind that 3.8% figure lie significant increases across key food categories. Meat prices climbed 5.8% year-over-year, with beef leading the pack at a staggering 16.5%. Egg prices rose 3.9%, while fresh fruit and vegetable prices increased by 5.0% and 3.7%, respectively. These aren’t anomalies. They reflect underlying cost pressures exacerbated by recent shifts in trade policy and supply chain strategy.

Since March, when both Canada and the United States implemented a new round of tariffs, the divergence in outcomes has been striking. U.S. food inflation has continued to cool, while Canada’s has nearly tripled over the same period.

Tripled.

In two integrated economies, this growing disparity should raise red flags.

The root causes are increasingly evident. Ottawa’s earlier decision to implement counter-tariffs disrupted long-standing North American procurement systems. In response, Canadian grocers began pivoting away from U.S. suppliers — particularly in categories like fresh produce and frozen foods — and turned to costlier or less efficient alternatives. The results are now showing up on the grocery bill.

Fortunately, that policy direction has changed. According to a recent report from Oxford Economics, Prime Minister @MarkJCarney quietly eliminated many of the counter-tariffs that had been inflating food costs. The decision, while politically delicate, was economically sound — and long overdue. Easing those restrictions is already beginning to relieve pressure along the supply chain. Over time, this could help stabilize or even slow food price growth.

But broader context matters. Among G7 nations, Canada now has the second-highest food inflation rate — behind only Japan. Food price increases in France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States remain well below Canada’s. That begs the question: Why is food more expensive in Canada than in almost every other advanced economy?

The answer is not just international volatility or climate shocks. It’s also about domestic choices. Tariffs, protectionist procurement practices, and structurally limited trade flexibility have created a uniquely Canadian inflation narrative — one driven more by internal policy than by external pressures.

And Canada’s geoeconomic leverage simply doesn’t compare to that of the United States. Not even close. That’s why Carney’s reversal on food-related tariffs represents an opportunity — to reset policy priorities and adopt a more pragmatic, less performative approach to affordability.

Canadians should welcome this shift. But they also deserve transparency. Food inflation cannot be solely blamed on global disruptions or seasonal cycles. It’s time we acknowledged how much of it is homegrown.

Moving forward, federal and provincial governments must coordinate more effectively, communicate with greater clarity, and ensure that access to affordable, nutritious food remains a national priority.

Of course, there’s nothing inherently wrong with patriotic consumerism. But “maplewashing” — the marketing of imported goods under misleading “Canadian” banners — is misleading and risks undermining public trust. Worse, it can distort markets and push prices even higher. Grocers should not abuse.

As for Ottawa, symbols like “Elbows Up” and “Canada’s Not For Sale” may have mobilized support during a volatile political moment, but they should never substitute for sound economic governance. Rhetoric can only go so far — and, in some cases, it blinds policymakers to the very consequences of their actions.

Canada’s food inflation story didn’t have to unfold this way. Now that we have an opportunity to correct course, let’s not waste it.

2025-05-21 09:22:32+00:00,"🇪🇺 Imports of fossil fuels cost the European Union around €375 billion a year. Electrification offers a unique opportunity to combine energy independence with the pursuit of our climate objectives.

Yesterday, @ChristianBuchel, President of UFE, was in Stockholm for the 2nd meeting of the European Business Nuclear Alliance, where he took part in the round table “Building Europe's Energy Future: Large-Scale Nuclear and Electrification” alongside Tom Erixon, (Alfa Laval / Industrikraft Sverige), @mwitucki  (@Konf_Lewiatan) and @LaurentLeveugle (@Fortum).

Today, electricity accounts for just 22% of final energy consumption in Europe. Sweden is leading the way with 34%, but meeting European climate targets will require at least 50% electrification by 2050.

To meet this ambition, France must:

➡️ Strategically plan investment in clean, affordable electricity ;
➡️ Massively support electrification technologies ;
➡️ Ensure a stable regulatory framework for flexibility, grids and digitisation ;
➡️ Make electrification a political and industrial priority.

At the European level, we need to combine sovereignty, competitiveness and climate ambition through tools such as  :

➡️ The Carbon Border Adjustement Mechanism (CBAM),
➡️A robust Emission Trading System (ETS),
➡️Strengthened interconnections
➡️The future European Electrification Bank dedicated to industry.

France must take the lead. Our already highly decarbonised electricity mix is a powerful lever to strengthen industrial competitiveness, energy sovereignty and climate leadership.

🇫🇷🇸🇪 The joint commitment of France and Sweden is essential if we are to rise to the energy challenges ahead and build the era of European electricity.

Earlier, the 2017 sanctions had already caused what CEPR estimates as over 40,000 deaths. Imports were blocked. The state's key foreign assets—like CITGO—were looted and stolen. 

Millions were driven into migration by engineered scarcity—openly fostered by Marco Rubio’s strategy to weaponize exodus as a tool for regime pressure.

2025-05-23 21:01:27+00:00,"""Keeping a tariff on tea to punish the U.S. is like taxing umbrellas to get back at the clouds. The real losers are not Washington lobbyists—but Kenyan farmers and Canadians.""

Time to Spill the Tea on Canada’s Misguided Tariffs

When Prime Minister Mark Carney quietly lifted most food-related countervailing tariffs on May 7, few Canadians noticed. There was no press release, no public statement—just a discreet policy shift mid-campaign. Yet several symbolic tariffs remain, notably on orange juice, coffee, alcohol, and tea. The rationale? Canadians can supposedly “find substitutes.”

But this logic quickly crumbles under scrutiny. These tariffs aren’t hurting the United States. They’re punishing countries like Kenya, India, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam—nations that actually grow tea and depend on its export for economic development and regional stability.

According to The Tea and Herbal Association of Canada, Canada does not grow or process tea at scale due to its climate and limited infrastructure. We lack the domestic capacity to cultivate, blend, package, or distribute tea commercially. Yet a 25% tariff remains on tea imports routed through the U.S., even when the product originates from the Global South. For example, tea grown in Malawi but warehoused or processed in the U.S. is still hit with the full tariff—penalizing African producers rather than American exporters.

The economic damage is now becoming more visible. Until recently, Canadian companies were absorbing the additional costs to shield consumers. That’s changing. Since January, retail tea prices have climbed by approximately 10%, and the pressure is mounting. One major importer now pays around $300,000 per month in tariffs. That level of cost absorption is not sustainable, particularly for mid-sized businesses without the margins to maneuver.

To avoid these punitive costs, some companies are exploring costly supply chain shifts to bypass the U.S. entirely. But these rerouting strategies come with enormous logistical burdens—delays, new regulatory hurdles, and higher operational expenses—all of which continue to be absorbed, for now, by businesses. But make no mistake: this fragile balancing act won’t last.

And when it finally breaks, it’s everyday Canadians—especially seniors and low-income families—who will bear the brunt. For many, tea is more than just a beverage. It’s a dietary and cultural staple, often one of the few affordable and healthy drinks that supports hydration and mental wellness. These benefits are well-recognized in Health Canada’s own nutritional guidelines.

Let’s be clear: this tariff isn’t protecting Canadian industry. There is no domestic tea-growing sector. The industry here revolves entirely around importation, blending, and branding—an ecosystem that contributes up to $1.3 billion annually to the Canadian economy and supports countless community programs, wellness initiatives, and food security projects. These businesses are being penalized not because of wrongdoing, but simply because of where their goods are routed.

There’s also no strategic upside. The United States is not the source of the tea being taxed. It is merely a transshipment point. The real exporters—mostly in the Global South—are suffering from reduced demand, while Canadians pay more for a basic, nutritious beverage found in millions of homes across the country.

Canada has made exceptions before when domestic substitutes didn’t exist—during the pandemic, for personal protective equipment, and again for essential manufacturing components. Tea clearly meets that same threshold.

If Ottawa truly wants to ease food inflation, maintain the integrity of its trade policy, and demonstrate a meaningful commitment to global equity, it must act now.

Scrap the tea tariff—before a misguided symbolic gesture becomes a needless economic hardship for communities at home and abroad.",Agri

Grocers should not be using tariffs as an excuse to increase prices.

This is Mark Carney’s inconvenient truth.

For Carney and for Canada’s food security, it was the right decision. But if you see academics or commentators on social media denying this happened, it simply means they’re being partisan.

The PVP/Rotation/FNF new launch farming is at an ATH and people are not trusting newer coins.

$Troll is an opportunity to return back to quality. $Troll is an opportunity to get a coin to multibillions that is logical and simple and known.

Regardless of if they will admit it, EVERY SINGLE PARTICIPANT here has seen the Trollface meme. There is not another meme besides maybe doge and Pepe in which that can be said.

$Troll is something special and it will be beautiful to watch it reprice. I encourage you all to get behind it. When this hits multi billions memes as a whole will have higher ceilings renewed.

The thesis is as simple or complex as you want it to be:

Simple: Troll, everyone is a Troll
Complex: Everyone knows the meme, and we trade meme coins. It has impacted internet culture on a level no other meme has. Btc has doge, shib has Pepe, Sol will have an og meme and it will be Troll.

Last week, Victoria Blazhko, Head of Editorial Content & Analytics at ASAP Agri, joined Germany's ARD channel network to explain how the EU’s return to quotas could shake up Ukraine’s grain exports.

 “If quotas go back to pre-war levels, wheat will take the hardest hit. Before the war, Ukraine had access to a 1 MMT annual quota. Under the recently agreed terms, that could shrink to just over half a million tonnes until the end of 2025, a prorated volume reflecting the mid-year rollout. Any shipments beyond that will be hit with a 95 EUR/MT tariff,” explains Blazhko.

🔁 In practical terms, Ukraine could be forced to reroute several million tonnes of wheat to alternative markets in 2025/26 — a major logistical shift that may weigh on prices and strain existing trade flows.

But there’s still light ahead:
☀️ Ukraine is gradually returning to traditional markets
🤝 Negotiations with the EU are ongoing
📈 And 2026 could bring a better trade framework

Over the past 20 years, India's has had net imports of as large as 7 MMT and has seen net exports of more than 10 MMT. This year's harvest is rapidly replenishing government-owned food stocks. India banned wheat exports in 2022 - 2024, draining reserves, pushing domestic prices to record highs and fueling speculation it would need imports for the first time since 2017 (see chart below). But things are improving and the stocks of the Food Corporation of India could build to 44 MMT vs a annual requirement of 18.4 million tons. With the world's second-largest wheat consumer not needing imports, global prices for the grain are likely to come under pressure, as output remains strong in top exporting countries while import demand from top consumer China has weakened. Global wheat prices have more than halved from the record highs of 2022, sliding earlier this month to their lowest level in nearly five years.

Ethanol suppliers can claim a credit on every litre produced under a UK scheme that seeks to cut harmful emissions from transport and promote greener fuels.

But ethanol made from waste products is eligible for a double credit as an incentive for producers to prioritise that production. ADM — the A in the so-called ABCD of international agribusinesses that play a pivotal role in global food supplies — took advantage of this to claim double credit on its fuel sold in the UK that is made from a byproduct of corn processing.

And support the British families here 
Support those that work 
Support our businesses 
Support our own supply of teachers and doctors support our games to produce more 
Support our own coal and oil industries and steel industries 
Support our infrastructure

Whilst really bringing down the DEMAND 

on housing, jobs, doctors, schools etc and that means drastically cutting immigration to net negative numbers and deporting those already here that shouldn't be here and don't work or who are not British and in prison or who have arrived by illegal means etc 

Our society is so imbalanced 

Demand is sky high and supply barely functioning 

This will never end well 

We need to bring down demand and increase supply 

When demand is high and supply low = prices are sky high ( good for fat cats. Bad for the people) 

When supply is high and demand low- prices crash ( great for the people , not so good for business) 

We need a happy balance 

An equilibrium 

As then as you know prices will come down , water and energy will be more available, so prices will come down, food supply will be more plentiful so prices will come down, there will be more houses to go round so prices will come down , there's be more school places, doctors will be able to breathe a sigh of relief as their corridors are less crowded ..

📊According to a survey by CJ Group targeting 6,800 consumers aged 15-49 across 24 cities in 12 countries, half (55%) of global consumers who have experienced K-Culture buy and eat K-food at least once a week. Additionally, 85% listen to K-pop at least once a week, and 60% watch K-content weekly. A CJ Group representative explained,
🥟“Chairman Lee Jae-hyun(이재현)’s seemingly impossible dream of making people worldwide watch two to three Korean films a year, eat Korean food 1~2 times a month, watch one or 2 Korean dramas a week, and listen to one or 2 Korean songs daily has finally become a reality.”
Last year, K-Beauty took the top spot as the number one export product to the U.S., surpassing France, and solidified its position as the top export sector to Japan. K-Beauty is also reaping significant benefits from the expansion of the K-Culture infrastructure. According to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, last year’s Korean cosmetics export hit a record high of $10.2 billion, up 20.6% from the previous year. University student Momoka (18), whom we met at the Loft store in Shibuya, Tokyo last month, said,
🇯🇵“After seeing Korean idols and influencers’ makeup on TikTok, I started to want to become pretty like them, which sparked my interest in K-Beauty.”
✍️K-Culture Experiences Interconnected with Food, Beauty, and More
Amid trade tensions triggered by the Trump administration, where traditional export pillars like automobiles, steel, and semiconductors suffered heavy damage, K-Culture emerged as an intangible social overhead capital and a ‘hidden card’ for Korean trade during economic crises. Analyzing global K-Culture-related keywords from 2022 to 2024, CJ Group found that overseas consumers’ experiences with K-Culture tend to be interconnected, crossing boundaries between K-food, K-pop, and more.
For example, preference for K-pop starting with BTS’s music extended to K-food with the launch of a new “Bibigo(비비고)” product commemorating member Jin’s military discharge, which then led to interest in ‘kimchi’ and ‘spicy flavors.’ 
In 2019, CJ CheilJedang led the expansion of K-food in the North American market by acquiring frozen food company Schwan’s for 2 trillion KRW. Its U.S. sales reached 4.7138 trillion KRW last year, about 13 times the amount in 2018. Federico Areola, brand marketing leader of Schwan’s, CJ CheilJedang’s U.S. subsidiary, said,
🥟“We have gained enormous benefits from K-Culture.”

It’s not just LLMs anymore, It’s Autonomous agents.

And @MagicNewton is building the infrastructure.

Autonomous agents are like AI workers. They can trade, farm, manage wallets, monitor chains, and even build apps without human input.

But the real problem?
There’s no secure, scalable way to deploy these agents on-chain Until Magic Newton came into the picture.

Newton is where open-source AI meets crypto-native automation.
All trustless and permissionless.

Yes $NEWT is the native token powering it all 🧠

Imagine you prompt an agent to find alpha, manage risk, and trade for you.
It learns your strategy, updates itself, and pays its own gas.

That’s not sci-fi. That’s Magic Newton.

The agent economy is coming, and Magic Newton is laying the rails.

2025-06-06 11:52:40+00:00,"Just One Nation Produces Enough Food For Itself, Scientists Reveal | Michael Irving, ScienceAlert

Global politics don't feel particularly cooperative at the moment, but which countries could actually feed themselves independently if all international food trade shut down?

Just one, according to a new study.

Researchers from the University of Göttingen in Germany and the University of Edinburgh analyzed food production data from 186 countries. The findings revealed that Guyana is the only country that can be entirely self-sufficient in all seven key food groups that the study focused on.

China and Vietnam were the runners-up, producing enough food to meet their populations' needs in six out of the seven categories.

Just one in seven countries hits the quota in five or more food groups, while more than a third are self-sufficient in two or fewer groups. Six countries – Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Macau, Qatar, and Yemen – were unable to meet self-sufficiency in any food group.

Even zooming out a little, economic unions made up of multiple countries showed similar patterns.

The Gulf Cooperation Council in the Middle East, for example, achieves self-sufficiency only in meat, while unions in West Africa and the Caribbean only hit the mark for two groups. No economic union produces enough vegetables to feed its entire population.

To fill the gaps and meet the dietary needs of their populations, most countries rely on trade. However, many still depend on a single trade partner for over half their imports, which leaves them especially susceptible to market shocks.

What is the Metalayer?
It’s not just a feature, it’s the core engine powering @Calderaxyz's vision of a unified, modular rollup world.
Today, chains are fragmented.
You bridge to one to trade, another to game, and yet another to farm yields.
Wallet switching, bridge delays, broken UX.
Even rollups suffer from this siloed structure.

Caldera’s Metalayer fixes that.
It’s an intent-based interoperability layer that connects every Caldera-powered rollup into one seamless, interoperable network.
That means:
— Trade on @HyperliquidX
— Play on ApeChain
— DeFi on Manta Pacific
and move assets or actions across all of them instantly, with no bridges or switching wallets.

The Metalayer handles everything behind the scenes; routing, messaging, asset transfer, and brings Ethereum-grade security to every interaction.

For devs?
➡️ Unified infra, faster deployment, easier app integrations.

For users?
➡️ Magic-like UX, no friction, just instant chain-hopping.

The Metalayer is what makes Caldera more than a rollup launcher.
It’s what makes it a new internet of modular, purpose-built chains that talk to each other natively.
This is how the rollup future scales.
This is how crypto wins UX.
And it's all powered by @Calderaxyz.

Not a fucking thing.

His Big Ugly Bill will take away food from children and the elderly, especially the very poor.  

His tariffs are already raising prices at the grocery stores so healthy choices are not always an option for people.

He is throwing poor adults and children off Medicaid and now the Senate wants to add Medicare cuts to his Big Ugly Bill.

He has already cut money from research grants for adults and children who have cancer and other diseases.  And more to come in his Big Ugly Bill.

Scientists are leaving the United States because of funding cuts.

He has cut money for Arts and museums.

As long as his billionaire buddies still can pay for all that and still have houses of gaudy gold Trump is a happy man.

Nigeria’s cocoa exports skyrocketed from N171 billion in 2023 to N2.71 trillion in 2024, a 1,486% jump, fueled by improved processing, mechanized farming, and value-added products.

This surge has revitalized agriculture, boosting forex earnings and creating jobs.

Stock Market Impact

FTN Cocoa Processors Plc, a major player, saw its stock climb from a 200-day average of N1.87 to N2.40, nearing its 52-week high of N2.75, with 1.72 million units traded at N4.18 billion.

Investors are increasingly drawn to agribusiness due to its strong growth potential.

Drivers of the Surge

Government Support: Export Expansion Grants and agro-processing loans enhance competitiveness.

Global Demand: High demand for quality cocoa products in Europe and Asia.

Investor Shift: Portfolios are pivoting to agriculture as a high-potential sector.

Naira Devaluation: Boosts profitability of cocoa exports, serving as a currency hedge.

2025-06-09 18:04:44+00:00,"""By protecting a shrinking sector with outdated tools, Canada isn’t just coddling dairy farmers — it’s abandoning its credibility, its consumers, and its future as a serious trading nation.""

Our Dairy Addiction Is Making Canada a Trade Pariah

When it comes to supply management and trade policy, Canada seems trapped in a cycle of repeating the same costly mistakes.

Before @MarkJCarney's arrival as Prime Minister, the previous Parliament adopted Bill C-282, introduced by the Bloc Québécois. The bill granted blanket immunity to Canada’s supply-managed sectors—most notably dairy—against any future concessions in trade negotiations, regardless of the partner or economic context. It effectively locked in protectionism for a system that is already struggling to justify itself in the modern global economy.

During the federal election campaign, on April 3, Mr. Carney stated in a @RadioCanadaInfo interview that no legislation was necessary to protect Canada’s dairy industry. It appears he has since changed his mind—or someone changed it for him.

Last week, the newly elected 45th Parliament unanimously passed Bill C-202, a near-identical copy of C-282. The Senate may still push back, as several senators have signaled concerns about the bill’s long-term economic implications. But the momentum is clear: supply management is once again being shielded from scrutiny under the pretense of national interest.

Politically, it’s a savvy move—especially for the @BlocQuebecois. In Ottawa, few MPs from any party dare challenge one of the most powerful lobby in the country: The @dfc_plc. Their influence is formidable, both federally and provincially.

But the question remains: What exactly are we protecting?

Canada has the highest industrial milk prices in the G7. This is not true for poultry or eggs—but it is for milk, a critical staple in household diets. These elevated prices do not necessarily lead to innovation or reinvestment. In fact, many producers are content to maintain the status quo, knowing the system protects them from competition. The result? Canadian consumers foot the bill for a sector with little incentive to become more efficient or cost-effective.

Defenders of supply management often point to food safety and quality. It’s true that bovine growth hormones are banned here. That’s commendable. But there are other practices that deserve more transparency.

A 2022 study published in Trends in Food Science and Technology revealed that palm oil derivatives are permitted in dairy cow feed in Canada. This may contribute to the now-documented phenomenon of firmer, less spreadable butter at room temperature—a story known as “Buttergate” was dismissed by dairy farmers initially, despite mounting evidence.

More recently, a peer-reviewed study co-authored by researchers at McGill and Dalhousie Universities and published in Ecological Economics estimated that Canada discards between 600 million and one billion litres of milk annually. The dairy lobby vehemently disputed these findings but has yet to present alternative data. The reality is simple: cows don’t stop producing milk when market demand fluctuates, and losses—whether in volume or value—are inevitable.

Canada’s dairy sector has long cultivated a culture of opacity. Rather than engage with critics or offer transparency, it leans on silence and self-congratulation. Accountability is elusive, and reform is taboo.

Looking ahead, Canada will need to renegotiate trade deals with the United States, Mexico, and other partners. Two choices await: we either pay billions in compensation to dairy farmers for theoretical “losses” each time concessions are made—a practice that borders on economic racketeering—or we forfeit our credibility as a reliable trade partner, unwilling to negotiate in good faith for a sector that represents less than 1 per cent of our GDP.

What message does this send to the world at a time when Canada urgently needs to diversify its economy?

By clinging to a misunderstood and outdated system, our elected officials are prioritizing short-term political gain over long-term economic progress. We are rewarding complacency and institutionalizing inefficiency—all under the guise of defending national interests.

The more things change, the more they stay the same.

UK food exports in Q1 2025 are down ⬇️ 20% in volume compared to Q1 2020.

The main drag 👉BREXIT non-tariff barriers, extra red tape, and weak demand in key EU markets.

👉 The UK has still not replaced EU market access with equivalent global trade flows. Trade deals with Australia, New Zealand, and CPTPP members are not delivering meaningful volume offsets.

The food sector is most harmed by Brexit. Seed potatoes, shellfish, plant growers, specialist dairy, processed meats — all once thriving exports — have been crippled by red tape, sanitary checks and trade barriers we simply didn’t face inside the Single Market.

Every week we delay rejoining the Single Market — we lose more businesses, more capacity, and more food security.

Imminently EU imports (heavily subsidised) will have their checks removed and will flood in and undercut British food even more.

Debrexiting is not a political luxury — it’s an economic necessity if we want to keep producing our own food, sustain rural communities, and maintain the high standards British consumers expect. The longer we wait, the harder it will be to rebuild lost markets, lost skills, and lost production. The urgency could not be greater.

They have raised over $20M in funding. 💰
They are Backed by Paradigm and Y Combinator

Yeah, @ycombinator — the same seed powerhouse that backed Airbnb, Coinbase, and Stripe — is behind Axiom too. They’re already clearing $100 million+ in daily volume and raking in $1M+ in daily fees. Not bad for an up-and-comer.

Every meme trade you make earns Points, which are meant to reward first movers — pretty likely they’ll convert to tokens down the road.

✅ Here’s how to get started:

Hit this link: https://t.co/f48GLUl1TP

1. Connect a Solana wallet (Phantom works great)
2. Secure your Recovery Key somewhere safe
3. Tap “Deposit” at the top
4. Load up with some SOL

To trade perps: jump to Perpetuals, top up your USDC balance by swapping SOL, and start trading. FYI — only meme trades score points, but perps should help your eligibility if they run an airdrop (very likely).

One more bonus: Axiom’s perps settle through Hyperliquid, so you might get the Hyperliquid Airdrop 2  too.

Check your Points on the Rewards tab, complete simple Quests, and rack up as much as you can while things are still under the radar.

(via https://t.co/d5FnQVT7qc)

Protesters have urged Brittany Ferries to stop live animal exports outside its Hampshire headquarters.

Compassion in World Farming campaigners and supporters gathered at the firm's Portsmouth headquarters on Saturday.

They want the company to reverse its decision, made earlier this year, to resume the live export of farmed animals from Ireland to France after a 30-year hiatus.

Campaigners say this trade subjects animals to extreme conditions and suffering, including overcrowding, exhaustion, dehydration, pain, and stress, often with little or no legal welfare protection.

Although a ban on live exports from Great Britain was made law via the Animal Welfare (Livestock Exports) Act in May 2024, Brittany Ferries has resumed the trade, joining competitors Irish Ferries and Stena Line.

The protesters positioned themselves near an advertising billboard that read ""Brittany Ferries: Stop the Cruelty"", aiming to raise awareness among Brittany Ferries’ passengers, staff, and passers-by about the company's involvement in the live export of animals for fattening and slaughter.

The company had stopped carrying farmed animals from Britain to mainland Europe 30 years ago.

Campaigners believe this decision reversal is exposing thousands of animals to suffering once again.",Agri

@defidotapp is a consumer-focused DeFi platform that enables you to trade and farm across multiple blockchain networks.

Its native token, $HOME, serves as both a utility and governance token, driving the platform’s ecosystem and incentivizing your participation through a ""flywheel"" mechanism.

This Flywheel Mechanism involves:/

◢ Your activities generating platform revenue i.e →trading and farming fees

◢ Community votes deciding how these revenues are used →buybacks or rewards.

◢ Fees flow to $HOME stakers, incentivizing more staking and user growth, which further increases revenue.

Now, this creates a self-reinforcing cycle

more users → more revenue → more rewards → more users 🔄

The DeFi App just simply aims to simplify DeFi interactions and making it accessible to a broad user base.

They recently conducted its Season 1 airdrop, distributing 10% of the total $HOME supply [which was doubled from an initial 5% based on community vote]

Where;

→ Airdrop claimers can stake their tokens to receive up to a 100% bonus allocation and a 3x XP multiplier for Season 2.

Staking $HOME unlocks additional benefits, including bonus token allocations, increased XP [experience points] for Season 2, and fee-sharing from platform revenue.

Stakers are core to the ecosystem, so they’ll automatically keep receiving incentives as the platform grows.

The $HOME token powers → gasless transactions across chains and unlocks enhanced features.

Grants → voting power on protocol decisions, such as revenue allocation and emissions.

Season 2 is the next phase of DeFi App’s ecosystem, focusing on enhanced user engagement and rewards

What you need to know about the XP System:

◢ XP [experience points] measures your activity and engagement on the platform.

◢ So staking $HOME in Season 2 can yield up to a 3x XP multiplier, increasing rewards and eligibility for future benefits.

◢ XP generation is tied to weekly token unlocks for stakers, aligning rewards with participation.

Also note that :|

◢ Season 2 XP may qualify you for future $HOME airdrops and reduced platform fees to encourage long-term involvement.

◢ The doubled Season 1 airdrop [from 5% to 10% of supply] was exclusively for stakers, showing a strong emphasis on rewarding active community members.

Season 2 continues this trend, with a 45% of the total $HOME supply allocated to community and ecosystem initiatives.

TL;DR

@defidotapp is a cross-chain decentralised finance platform powered by the $HOME token, which drives gasless transactions, governance, and staking rewards.

Its tokenomics revolve around a flywheel model: 

→user activity generates revenue →which is distributed to stakers based on governance votes →attracting more users.

Season 2 introduces an XP system, where staking $HOME unlocks up to 3x XP multipliers, bonus tokens, and potential future airdrops or fee reductions.

With 45% of the supply dedicated to the community, DeFi App incentivizes active participation to fuel ecosystem growth.

Wasabi is the only platform I know where you can stake memecoins , yes, really. I’ve staked $pengu, $fwog, $giga, $spx and more lately and racked up over $400 in rewards. APRs can spike high for short periods(30% currently on Base $USDC), but with a bit of farming discipline it’s worth it!

Even when APR is low, you still earn points , and we all know what that might mean… potential airdrop (we're in SZN 3).

Jumps are largely due to a shortfall in Canadian domestic chicken production, with 8 million kg of underproduction recorded between April and May 2025—the worst in over 50 years.

Canada's chicken supply crunch is a structural outcome of a tightly controlled system (SUPPLY MANAGEMENT) that lacks short-term flexibility. When underproduction happens, it can't be corrected overnight—so processors turn to imports, as shown in the latest CARI report.

I just made my first deposit 🙈!!!

And I also just did my first AIXBT/USD trade on dYdX, and I’m literally obsessed 💅

I started with AIXBT because it's one of the boosted pair

I downloaded the @dYdX Mobile App and connected my @zerion wallet using Wallet Connect

As a beginner, dYdX’s interface felt welcoming

I noticed @aixbt_agent dipping to $0.1778 on the 30-minute chart, with buy orders piling up on dYdX’s order book

so I bought at $0.1788 with 2x leverage (safe for a newbie), stop at $0.1770

Closed immediately. $dYdX’s 0.025% fees were barely noticeable

Steps for beginners:

➤Get a wallet: Download @Rabby_io Wallet Extension, set it up, and connect on https://t.co/otsGf0NiFZ. Fund with USDC Arb

➤Explore AIXBT/USD: Go to markets. AIXBT/USD’s liquid, with $42.82 in perpetuals 

➤Learn the basics: Use dYdX’s dashboard to check prices and order books. Start with low leverage (2x).

➤Place a trade: Choose “Market” order, set a small position, and add a stop-loss. Confirm in Rabby.

➤Check progress: See your trade on the dashboard. Close when you’re up.

So many questions that I feel people will ask started rushing into my head!! 

And one of the many is WHAT ARE BOOSTED PAIRS?

Yeah, I mentioned it in my last BEGINNERS tweet.

Boosted trade pairs on dYdX are trading pairs that earn double points as part of the rewards program, encouraging more trading activity.

These points can lead to higher leaderboard rankings and $DYDX token rewards at the end of the month. 

However, since dYdX updates these pairs periodically, it's wise to verify the current list on the platform. ❤️

Boosted trade pairs on dYdX include: 

➤ XRP (@XRP_Alerts ) ➠ Higher leaderboard ranking

➤ AIXBT (@aixbt_agent ) ➠ Increased $DYDX token rewards

➤ KAITO (@KaitoAI ) ➠ Enhanced trading incentives

➤ SUI (@SuiNetwork ) ➠ Boosted DEX trading activities

These boosted pairs change periodically, like I said earlier, due to dYdX aiming to promote different markets based on liquidity needs and market conditions

So, it's best to always check the platform regularly.

You ever feel like you’re being hunted when you trade on-chain?

That’s not paranoia, it’s MEV.

But dYdX took a different route.
No mempool. No gas wars. No front-running.

Let me show you how they engineered fairness by design 🧵👇

♡ Most blockchains are battlegrounds.
You vs bots. And bots usually win.

You place a trade → it waits in the mempool → bots jump ahead and eat your edge.

Welcome to the world of MEV:
Maximal Extractable Value
…or as I call it:
The silent tax on your trades.

♡ But here’s the twist:

dYdX said NO to this system.
Literally redesigned their own chain to shut it down.

Instead of building on Ethereum or Solana, they went full sovereign,
and built the dYdX Chain from scratch using CometBFT + Cosmos SDK.

Why? To erase MEV at the root.

♡ How?
No mempool.

Trades go directly to validators, privately, without being exposed in public.

There’s no chance for bots to peek and pounce.
No time for front-runners to sandwich your move.

Just: you click → the trade happens → done.

♡ This isn’t a patch.
It’s a layer-1 design philosophy.

Most chains accept MEV as inevitable.
dYdX chose to reject it.

Because real traders, pros, institutions, don’t mess with chains that can’t guarantee fair execution.

♡ By removing the mempool and auctioning, dYdX neutralizes:

✓ Sandwich attacks
✓ Gas bidding wars
✓ Hidden slippage
✓ Bots frontrunning your entries

You trade with full price integrity.

♡ This is more than just performance, it’s about trust.

On-chain trading has always come with fine print:
“Beware of bots, whales, and randomness.”

dYdX wants to flip that:
“Welcome to a fairer, faster, bot-free battlefield.”

♡ And let’s talk real-world impact:

• Clean entries
• Precise exits
• Less noise
• Higher conviction in your trades
• Confidence to size in without sweating bots watching your every move

That’s alpha.

♡ Most chains ask you to adapt to the rules.
dYdX rewrote them.

It’s not just another DEX, it’s a purpose-built ecosystem engineered for serious traders.

Fairness isn’t a feature.
It’s the foundation.

♡ So the next time someone asks why dYdX matters
don’t just say “good UX” or “cheap fees.”

Say this:

“Because it’s the only chain where traders don’t get robbed before their trade even lands.
Because it rewired the rules to protect your edge, not extract it.”

That’s what real innovation looks like.

Meanwhile spot me and my colleagues chilling 😁🥂 and of course talking about dYdX🫶",Agri

As lower-quality imports rise, we risk creating a two-tier food system: safe, nutritious food for those who can afford it — and cheap, chemically-treated goods for everyone else.

Meanwhile, UK farmland is forcibly being redirected — not to grow food, but to serve other political goals: building houses, planting biodiversity credits, or helping the UK hit net-zero targets.

If this continues without proper safeguards, Britain may end up offshoring both environmental harm and food production, all while gutting its rural economy.

2025-06-20 10:38:58+00:00,"🚨 Something BIG is happening in Web3. And it starts with @MANTRA_Chain + @dimitratech 
This isn’t just a partnership — it’s a global shift in how we farm, trade, and finance the world.

Let’s break it down 👇

🌾 Real Farms. Real Impact. Real Assets — Onchain.
@MANTRA_Chain , the RWA chain, is teaming up with Dimitra, the agri-tech titan bringing blockchain to farmers worldwide. The goal? Tokenize agriculture.
We’re talking about cacao from the Amazon, carbon credits in Mexico, and farm yields across the globe — turned into liquid, traceable, and tradeable digital assets.

→ Imagine buying a piece of a cacao farm. Not in theory. Onchain. In your wallet.

Why this matters:
🔹 Smallholder farmers gain access to global capital markets
🔹 Investors tap into real-world yields backed by crops, not speculation
🔹 Carbon credit projects become transparent, verifiable, and fraud-proof
🔹 Supply chains get smarter, faster, and more accountable

📌 The tech stack is unmatched:
• MANTRA provides the secure, scalable Layer 1 chain for real-world asset tokenization
• Dimitra delivers on-the-ground data, agricultural insights, and blockchain-ready farming platforms
Together, they’re building the infrastructure to bring billions of dollars in farmland and sustainability assets into DeFi.

This is how you take RWAs from hype to harvest.
Not just headlines — hectares.
Not just tokens — trees, tractors, and transformation.

✅ The future of food, finance, and farming is being built right now. And it’s happening on MANTRA, powered by Dimitra.

📢 Watch this space. The new green revolution is Web3-native.

2025-06-20 14:42:15+00:00,"Ever wondered how the perfect DeFi wallet would be?

Let's walk down a quick story.

Meet Chinedu and Ada — the perfect DeFi couple.
Chinedu has always tried to be the best boyfriend and ensured he was able to:

Borrow money

Trade crypto

Stake tokens for passive income

Farm tokens to earn yields

Switch strategies without starting over

But you know girls — they’re never satisfied (no offence to the ladies 😅).

At her workplace, Ada met Abdul. Good-looking, strong, well-built — but there was something special about him.

Unlike Chinedu who had to run around different apps and waste time, Abdul used just one single app to carry out all his DeFi activities.

It was like the super app — fast, scalable, and seamless.
Ada wanted that. She didn’t want a guy who had to move across 5 different apps just to stake, swap, or farm.

So guess what?
She cheated on her perfect boyfriend. 💔

Heartbreaking, right?

A few months passed, and Chinedu discovered the truth.
He regretted not having a setup where he could do it all in one place. He had to move between apps just to keep up.

So you — yes, you reading this — don’t be like Chinedu who ended up regretting not switching to @stackfibase's Credit Account Abstraction.

Have the super wallet in your hands and carry out DeFi the way it's meant to be — fast, seamless, scalable.

2025-06-20 16:25:25+00:00,"🦔 The end of the ""de minimis"" tariff loophole is reshaping global e-commerce in ways most people don't realize.

What changed:
• Packages under $800 used to enter the U.S. duty-free from China
• Since May 2, these face tariffs up to 54%
• Small package shipments from China dropped 40% in May

Who got hit hardest:
Companies like Shein and Temu built their entire business models around this loophole. They could ship directly to U.S. customers without tariffs, keeping prices super low. Now they're facing double-digit sales declines and having to raise prices.

The ripple effects:
Small Chinese merchants are getting squeezed out of the U.S. market entirely. One entrepreneur I read about now loses $2 on every parcel, forcing him to switch to bulk shipments that require $13,800 upfront for inventory.

What's happening globally:
While China-to-U.S. shipments crashed, total Chinese small package exports actually rose 40% as other countries picked up the slack. Malaysia, Belgium, and South Korea are now major destinations.

Why this matters:
This shows how quickly trade policy can reshape global commerce. Companies that seemed unstoppable are suddenly struggling, while new trade routes emerge overnight. For consumers, it means higher prices on cheap goods from China and fewer options for direct-to-consumer purchases.

The era of ultra-cheap Chinese goods delivered straight to your door is ending.

2025-06-21 06:02:14+00:00,"📊 Understanding How Trading Works on Hibachi: Perpetual Futures vs Spot

When you place a trade on Hibachi, you’re not buying or selling the actual token like you would on a traditional spot exchange. Instead, you’re trading a perpetual futures contract (perp) — a type of derivative that allows you to speculate on the price movement of an asset without actually owning it.

🧠 Here’s what that means:

Instead of purchasing a token like ETH or BTC directly, you’re entering into a contract where you go long (betting the price will rise) or go short (betting the price will fall) on that asset. To do this, you provide collateral in USDT — the stablecoin that backs your position.

This model gives you powerful advantages:
•✅ Leverage: Control a larger position with less capital.
•✅ Flexibility: Profit whether the market moves up or down.
•✅ No Expiry: Unlike traditional futures, perps don’t expire — you can hold your position as long as you maintain margin.

🆚 Spot Trading, on the other hand, is straightforward asset ownership. You’re exchanging one token for another (e.g., USDT for ETH), and you own that ETH until you decide to sell it.

🔐 @hibachi_xyz , every perpetual trade is transparently recorded and secured using cryptographic proofs — giving you the experience of a high-performance CEX with DeFi-grade transparency.

Whether you’re a seasoned derivatives trader or just starting out, understanding the difference between perps and spot is essential. On Hibachi, you’re not just trading — you’re tapping into a smarter, more dynamic way to engage with the market.

2025-06-21 15:01:54+00:00,"How Trading Fees Fund $DYDX Buybacks and Staking Rewards

♡ The flywheel that powers the chain, not just the token.

Most DeFi tokens make promises.
dYdX built a feedback loop.

What if I told you every trade on dYdX isn’t just execution…
It’s fuel for the @dYdX economy?

Let’s unpack how real protocol revenue funds buybacks, staking, and long-term value 🧵👇

1. Let’s start with the obvious: dYdX charges trading fees.

Like every exchange, there are fees for:
•Opening a position
•Closing it
•Holding it overnight (funding)

But unlike many protocols, these fees don’t disappear into a black hole, or into the pockets of anonymous insiders.

They go back into the ecosystem.

This is where it gets interesting 👇

2. Enter the Treasury Vault.

All trading fees on dYdX Chain flow into the dYdX Treasury Vault, a decentralized smart contract governed by the community.

No middlemen. No team allocation. Just real revenue owned by the chain.

This vault is the engine room for:
•Monthly token buybacks
•Staking rewards
•Ecosystem incentives

3. Buybacks, but with real cashflow.

At the end of each month, the protocol uses part of the trading fee revenue to buy DYDX on the open market.

Not pre-minted tokens. Not inflationary emissions.

Actual protocol earnings used to re-acquire tokens, supporting price, signaling conviction, and redistributing value.

And the kicker?

These bought-back tokens are locked in a smart contract, not dumped, not recycled.

4. Stakers get paid in kind.

A portion of the vault funds also goes toward staking rewards for validators and delegators securing the dYdX Chain.

This creates a security loop:
•Traders fund the system
•Stakers secure it
•The protocol pays both sides

No unsustainable emissions.
No inflation just to pay yield.

Just real economic activity → real value creation.

5. Why This Matters

Most DeFi tokens suffer from the same disease:
High inflation, weak revenue, no real value loop.

dYdX flipped the model:
•Zero token emissions
•100% revenue-funded rewards
•Buybacks from actual usage

It’s not a narrative, it’s a machine.

In Summary 

dYdX’s trading fees power a full-cycle economy:
•Users trade → fees are collected
•Protocol buys back $DYDX monthly
•Stakers get rewarded from real yield
•Tokens are locked, not sold

It’s how you build value.
Not by minting more tokens, but by earning it.

Next time you see someone trading on dYdX, remember, they’re not just executing.
They’re funding the future of DeFi.",Agri

During World War II, the Maldives faced food shortages and rising prices due to disrupted imports, prompting the government to launch a campaign encouraging local food cultivation across all inhabited islands, with emissaries guiding communities. Communities transformed vacant lands into gardens, notably in Male’s four Avahs (wards), while a rationing system ensured fair rice distribution. Under the State Governing Council, initially led by Hassan Fareed Didi and later by Mohamed Amin Didi, the government controlled prices, inventoried assets, and reduced jobs and salaries by one-fifth. Despite setbacks in later reforms, the Maldivian people’s unity and resilience enabled them to overcome these challenges, fostering self-reliance and enduring strength.

2025-06-22 23:04:35+00:00,"Closure of the Strait of Hormuz & the impact on the price of farm produce in Nigeria.

Surge in Oil and Fuel Prices: The Strait of Hormuz handles about 20% of global oil and 20% of LNG trade. A closure could push Brent crude oil prices to $120-$150 per barrel, or even $350 in extreme scenarios. Nigeria, despite being an oil producer, relies heavily on imported refined petroleum products due to limited domestic refining capacity. A spike in global oil prices would increase the cost of petrol and diesel, potentially reaching N2,000-N3,000 per litre in Nigeria.

Increased Agricultural Input Costs: Nigerian farmers depend on imported inputs like fertilizers, pesticides, and machinery fuel. The Middle East, via the Strait, supplies 16.3% of global seaborne fertilizer trade. A closure would disrupt these supplies, driving up prices.

Food Inflation and Supply Chain Disruptions: Higher fuel and input costs would translate to elevated food prices. Nigeria’s inflation rate, already high (around 32% in mid-2025), could worsen as transport and production costs due to our Nigeria’s import-dependent economy. Additionally, Nigeria imports agricultural commodities like wheat and sugar through global trade routes affected by higher shipping costs and insurance premiums, exacerbating food price hikes.

Currency Pressure and Economic Instability: Nigeria’s reliance on oil exports (over 80% of foreign exchange earnings) means a global price spike could temporarily boost revenue, but a Strait closure would disrupt trade logistics, weakening the naira due to higher import bills. A weaker naira would make imported inputs and food even more expensive, hitting consumers hard. Rural farmers, often operating on thin margins, would struggle to absorb these costs, potentially reducing output and tightening food supply.

Mitigating Factors: Nigeria has strategic petroleum reserves covering 9-10 days of consumption, which could buffer short-term disruptions. Diversified oil imports from Russia, the U.S., and West Africa (e.g., Nigeria’s 5% crude imports from Africa) could ease some pressure. However, these measures are insufficient for a prolonged closure, and global spare oil capacity (5.7 million bpd, mostly in Saudi Arabia and UAE) is largely Strait-dependent, limiting relief.

Estimated Impact: Based on historical precedents like the 1970s oil shocks, a sustained closure could double or triple transport and input costs, potentially increasing staple food prices (e.g., rice, yam, or tomatoes) by 30-50% within weeks. Poorer households, spending 60-70% of income on food, would face severe hardship 

Brace up dear farmers!
We hope for dialogue sooner than later. 

Summary:
Striat of Hormuz closure will affect oil movement, which will affect food price in Nigeria. Smallholder farmers will be poorer, food prices will go up, and urban dwellers will spend more on food.

Why do they loose the money ? 

People often lose money in degen (degenerate) trading because it’s very risky and fast-paced. Many jump into trades without enough research or strategy, chasing quick profits based on hype or rumors. 

This leads to bad decisions, big losses, and sometimes falling for scams or rug pulls. The pressure to act fast and fear of missing out (FOMO) can make things worse.

How @doomislive is coming to treat this situation!

2025-06-24 09:56:03+00:00,"Technical indicators aren’t about predicting the future. ❤️

They’re about increasing your odds.

If you trade perpetuals on @dYdX, you don’t need 50 different signals, you need 3 or 4 solid ones that work together.

Here’s what I actually use when I’m mapping trades:

➠ Moving Averages (MAs)
Simple but powerful. I use the 50 and 200 EMA.

If price is above both? I only long dips.
If it’s below both? I wait for short setups.

The trend is your friend until it flips, and these lines show that clean.

➠ Relative Strength Index (RSI)
Not to blindly trade overbought/oversold, but to spot divergences.

When price makes a higher high but RSI makes a lower high? That’s a bearish divergence. I watch for reversal.

This saved me during a long on $ARB. RSI flashed divergence, I exited early hours later, the market nuked.

➠Volume
No volume = no conviction.

If I see price pumping but volume’s flat, I don’t touch it.
If price dumps on high volume, I wait for it to bottom out, then look for bounce plays.

You can see volume right below your candles on dYdX, use it.

➠Bollinger Bands
These help me time exit. When the price touches the upper band after a run-up, I start scaling out.

If it hugs the lower band with oversold RSI? I prepare for a bounce.

➠Fibonacci Retracements
Not magic, but useful.

I use the 0.618 level often. If the price pulls back there after a breakout and holds, I’ll look for entries with tight risk.

Draw it from swing low to swing high, super quick on the chart.

I’m not using Ichimoku Clouds, MACD, or any of that. 

These few indicators, combined with basic support/resistance, help me:

➤Time entries

➤Manage exits

➤Size up the trade

➤Set real stop losses and take profits

Next time someone says “indicators don’t work in crypto,” ask them if they’ve actually traded with a system.

Because with the right tools and risk management, TA doesn’t just help,it keeps you alive.

And $dYdX makes it easy to execute that plan.

Inflation is down, wages are rising.  Jobs are plentiful.  Tariff revenue is up.  Trade deals have been signed —Canada, the U.K., with others in the hopper.

WhileAmericans are struggling to put food on the table, the Federal Reserve has been living it up. Spending billions of dollars on the renovation of two of its field offices in Washington, D.C.

Lavish rooftop garden terraces,  ornate water fountains, new elevators that drop board members off directly in their “Marie Antoinette” VIP dining suite. 
Extravagant white marble, rooftop Italian beehives, and a private art collection in the basement.

No luxury has been spared for the bankers at the fed.

Initially slated to cost $1.9 BILLION, the new renovation budget has ""ballooned"" by 32%, bringing the new total to $2.5 billion, Senators reported in the Banking commission hearing.",Agri

I wrote a song for @Maiga_AI      @VictorLeeJW 
Not for clout, not for views — but to show I mean it.
This isn’t just a tweet. This is how I prove I’m not just here to farm.
I’m here to trade, to build, and to rise with Maiga.

🎵 ""We Trade, We Rise""
This track is dedicated to Maiga, and to every Snap warrior grinding day in and day out.
Every Snap, every trade on-chain — it’s not just a score.
It’s part of our Web3 résumé.
Maiga isn’t your average airdrop trap.
It’s built different:
No VC cliffs.
No stealth dump.
No whales-only club.

Instead, it’s powered by the Proof of Trading (PoT) mechanism:
→ Tokens are unlocked through real trading activity
→ Everything is on-chain, fair, and transparent
→ Everyone can earn by creating real value
If you’re ready to be part of a system where trading = value creation,
then step in.
Snap in.
And let the chain see you rise.
🎧 Full lyrics below — this is my gift to Maiga,

我為 @maiga_AI 寫了一首歌，
不是開玩笑，是認真的那種——寫詞、寫到凌晨那種。
這不是為了博流量，是想送給她，證明我真的有在「做交易，不只是做任務」。

🎵《We Trade, We Rise》
這是一首寫給 Maiga，也寫給所有嘴嚕者的主題曲。
我們每天的 Snap、每一筆鏈上的交易，不只是刷分，是在累積自己的 Web3 履歷。
Maiga 則是一個真正給你舞台的平台，讓你透過「Proof of Trading」機制，
用真實交易行為來解鎖代幣、打造價值。

它不是靠 VC 配額，不靠內部名單，也不是那種幣一上就被砸爛的設計。
它的核心是公平、透明、鏈上驗證。
每一筆交易，都是你為這個項目貢獻的一磚一瓦。
如果你也想參與這場「交易即價值」的革命，那就：
Snap 起來，讓鏈上知道你在戰鬥。
🎧 歌詞我放下面，這是我對 Maiga 的承諾，也是我們共同的戰歌👇

Half of the British people’s income during the 1830s and 1840s was spent on food. The country was rife with hunger, destitution, and riots over food. Ireland was gripped with famine. The shortages and high cost of grain was due to the Corn Laws, which levied tariffs as high as 80% on grain imports. The venal system enriched the landed gentry at a time when most Britons were not allowed to serve in Parliament or vote.

As a one time supporter of the Laws, British Prime Minister Robert Peel (pictured here with me in statue form in London) reversed his position in response to crisis, introducing legislation to end grain protectionism. His policy U-turn split his Conservative party and he lost his job doing the right thing.

2025-06-28 06:13:31+00:00,"From Mandis to Markets: How Modi’s Trade Nationalism and Agri Push Aim to Reboot Bharat’s Income Engine:

In a world where free trade often comes dressed in the robes of neocolonialism, the Modi government’s posture has been unmistakably clear—India will not bend backwards to sign any deal that compromises its strategic or economic sovereignty. Whether it was walking out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) or taking a tough stand at the WTO on issues of agricultural subsidies and food stockpiling, India has signalled that its market access is not up for grabs without reciprocity. The narrative has shifted—from being a compliant negotiator seeking global validation to a self-assured state asserting its terms with confidence. Even the recent FTA talks with the UK and EU have seen Indian negotiators hold their ground on labour clauses, digital trade barriers, and non-tariff conditions that disproportionately benefit the West. What is quietly but powerfully emerging is a framework of 'pragmatic nationalism'—a willingness to integrate with global markets, but not at the cost of farmers, MSMEs, or national priorities.

At the heart of this trade assertiveness lies the silent but seismic understanding that India cannot aspire to become a $5 trillion economy without modernising its agrarian core. Agriculture, which employs nearly half of India’s workforce, contributes less than 15% to GDP. The math is unflattering and unsustainable. The real problem is not food production—India has surplus grains—but low productivity, fragmented land holdings, and negligible value addition. Without cold chains, storage, logistics, and agri-tech infusion, the farmer remains shackled to local mandis and middlemen. What India needs is not just food security but income security for its farmers, and that comes from treating agriculture not as welfare but as enterprise. When agriculture becomes part of the value chain—from farm to fork to foreign export—the rural economy can become a real contributor to per capita income. The government’s PLI schemes, drone-based land surveys, and push for FPOs are early signs of this shift. But without sustained capital infusion and a regulatory framework that enables rather than controls, the promise of doubling farmer income will remain a slogan. The link is clear—only when the farmer earns more can the nation earn more. Until then, no trade deal, however strategic, can truly deliver growth that touches every Indian.

At the same time, agriculture modernisation is a must. No region or interest groups should be allowed to hold India's progress via their emotional blackmailing. The world is changing, so should we. The culture has to shift towards productivity, from MSP. And 90% of Indian farmers are already on board.

I hope @narendramodi Government will keep the interests of majority in mind and push for modernised and mechanised agri growth. That'll be a real game changer for Bharat.",Agri

If you mainly trade pairs like $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, and $HYPE, then Extended might be the right choice for you, these pairs have high liquidity, making order execution smooth and cost-efficient.

1/ What about trading fees?

Fixed fee structure:
- Taker: 0.025%
- Maker: 0.000%

These are very competitive fees — especially with a 0% Maker fee, allowing you to place limit orders at no cost, which is a major advantage compared to many other perpetual trading platforms.

2/ Point farming strategy?

Season 1 of the Points Program launched on April 29, 2025, with 1.2 million points distributed weekly, every Tuesday at 00:00 UTC.

You’ll earn reward points when trading pairs like $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, and $HYPE. However, if you want to maximize your points, I recommend trading some TradFi pairs as well. According to their Weekly Recap, there's a separate section for Highest TradFi Trading Volume, which suggests there might be a dedicated point mechanism for these pairs. More details here:

https://t.co/PheInKT65Z

In fact, they distribute over 1 million points each week to around 1,000 traders. With the user base still relatively small, this is a golden opportunity to farm points efficiently, especially if you get in early!

In addition to trading, you can also earn more points by providing liquidity, namely depositing assets into the Vault. Currently, the Vault has reached its limit of 7.5 million dollars, so it is temporarily unable to deposit more, but I believe they will soon increase the limit to expand to more participants.

You can read more about their points program here: https://t.co/JUNR4WCs1H

3/ Don’t be just a point hunter.

Don't be too obsessed with farming points, it's not a sustainable strategy. Focus on maximizing your trading profits, and the bonus points will come naturally to you every week as a worthy reward.

Be a smart trader, not just a point hunter.

2025-06-29 13:54:57+00:00,"The Globalism Hangover: What Trump’s Trade War Got Right

“Trump’s bombastic style aside, his nationalist approach to trade and food policy is forcing global institutions to justify their existence—and that’s a conversation Canada can no longer afford to ignore.”

For the past six months, President Donald Trump’s trade policies have been widely mocked, criticized, and condemned. Some of it is certainly warranted. The Wall Street Journal, for instance, recently likened his tariff-heavy approach to global trade as a direct path toward another Great Depression. But data out of the United States tells a more nuanced story—one that challenges conventional wisdom.

Despite persistent headwinds, the U.S. economy continues to outperform expectations. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta projects second-quarter GDP growth at 3.8%. In May, the U.S. economy added 139,000 jobs, outpacing forecasts, while inflation remained subdued at 0.1% month-over-month and 2.4% annually. The U.S. trade deficit has been cut nearly in half, pointing to stronger export performance and a rebalancing of trade relationships.

Canada, by contrast, is showing signs of economic strain. The national economy is shrinking, manufacturing is struggling under U.S. trade pressure, and food inflation is outpacing general inflation. In short, our economy is not keeping pace—despite our public criticism of the Trump administration.

To make matters worse, the Trump administration has now halted all trade negotiations with Canada, signaling that our bilateral economic relationship holds little strategic value for Washington. For the U.S., Canada is no longer a priority—especially under a Carney-led government that has visibly pivoted toward Europe, a market still heavily invested in maintaining close ties with the United States. From an agri-food standpoint, this shift is consequential: access to our largest trading partner is narrowing, while Ottawa appears more focused on diplomatic optics than on securing stable, competitive trade channels for the Canadian agrifood economy.

This is the one thing the 'Elbows Up' crowd never understood—and still doesn’t. We’re not in a trade war with the U.S. There’s no war to be won. For Trump, this is about a realignment of the global order, plain and simple—one centered entirely on American supremacy.

Love him or loathe him, Trump is not destroying the U.S. economy—not yet, anyway. His unapologetically nationalist agenda extends far beyond tariffs. He has withdrawn U.S. support from key global institutions such as the WHO and is threatening to sever ties with others, including NATO and several UN-affiliated agencies. Among them is the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the UN’s most authoritative body on food security.

At a recent event in Brazil, a senior FAO official acknowledged that fundraising dynamics have shifted. In the Trump era, governments are asking harder questions: Why should we fund the FAO? What domestic benefit does it provide? What used to be assumed support is now conditional—and arguably, more accountable.

This shift isn’t unique to Washington. Many countries are quietly aligning with the U.S. position, scrutinizing globalist institutions with renewed skepticism. Transparency and accountability are byproducts of this anti-globalist sentiment—something not inherently negative.

For decades, globalism pushed the world to believe that trade liberalization was the only viable path to growth and prosperity. It became conventional wisdom. But globalism has made some nations—and some people—richer, while leaving others behind. In the process, domestic sectors, including agriculture, were often sidelined or sacrificed in the name of global efficiency.

The problem with globalism, particularly in agri-food policy, is its tendency to pursue uniformity over relevance. Canada, for example, adopted the carbon tax under a globalist climate agenda that often overlooks the vital role food producers play in feeding people. Instead of being supported, the sector is too often vilified as a problem. But agriculture is not a liability—it is a necessity.

Trump’s message—wrapped, of course, in provocative and often abrasive language—is that one-size-fits-all global policies rarely work. Nations have different socio-economic realities, and those should come first. While cooperation is essential, so is recognizing local and regional priorities. In this sense, his “America First” approach is not without logic—especially when it seems to be yielding short-term economic gains.

For Canada’s agri-food sector, the lesson is clear: striking a better balance between global commitments and national imperatives is overdue. We should not abandon multilateral cooperation, but we must stop anchoring policy to global agendas we have little influence over. Instead, let’s define what works for Canadians—what supports our farmers, protects our food security, and reflects our unique landscape—while keeping the broader global context in view.

We are not there yet. But if this moment of disruption sparks a more realistic and regionally attuned approach to food policy, we’ll be better for it.",Agri

Among the key questions raised by the audience were:

1️⃣ Vessel arrests and payment delays in Egypt 
2️⃣ Quality-related disputes in Tunisia 
3️⃣ Shortage traps in Tunisia’s ODC contracts

According to Pavlo, the most common triggers of contractual disputes in agri trade are:

🔹 Non-payment
🔹 Non-delivery
🔹 Demurrage / detention

Together, these issues account for more than 58% of all contract-related trade cases.

We focus on China’s rise as a technological competitor. We introduce novel quantitative metrics such as the Export Similarity Index, the Partner Similarity Index, and the Ideal Point Distance to examine global shifts in trade patterns and sectoral competition. Our findings highlight competitive pressures in critical sectors, including machinery and advanced manufacturing, with implications for geopolitical alignment and economic stability. We explore strategic policy responses by major economies, with a particular focus on the evolving policy stance of the Euro Area, and assess emerging vulnerabilities stemming from changing patterns of import dependence.""

If past imports were fine, why re-export these vehicles? These are everyday Sri Lankans’ hard-earned savings, trapped in irrevocable LCs, built up to buy cars after a 4-year import ban.

*   Own everything: Your tools, pets, land, and farm output are all NFTs.
*   Multi-token economy:

Washington just dropped a diplomatic truth bomb on Brasília — and the fallout has a very familiar name: Alexandre de Moraes.

According to a statement relayed via the U.S. Embassy, President Donald Trump made it clear that Brazil’s growing censorship, particularly the authoritarian antics of Supreme Court Justice Moraes, was a key reason behind the stunning new 50% import tax imposed by the United States. The Brazilian public has already coined the penalty “Taxa Moraes” — fitting for a man who’s done more to silence free speech than protect it.

This wasn’t just about economics. Trump’s message was political — and surgical. If you want unrestricted access to American markets, maybe start by respecting constitutional rights and ending the witch hunts against political opponents. It turns out banning opposition voices and persecuting former presidents like Jair Bolsonaro has a price tag.

Ironically, Moraes and Lula have spent years lecturing about “democracy” while censoring critics, jailing journalists, and criminalizing dissent. Now their Orwellian playground is costing Brazil real money. That’s the kind of international embarrassment you can’t cover up — not even with another gag order.

In short: play stupid games, win stupid tariffs. Maybe next time the Brazilian Supreme Court will spend more time upholding the Constitution and less time micromanaging Twitter.",Agri

He’d place a forex trade on one screen, then flip to another to farm yields in DeFi. The systems never spoke to each other. He always had to manage risk twice, track balances twice, and learn tools that felt like different languages.

One day, during a major market swing, his crypto wallet glitched, and his forex broker froze withdrawals due to compliance checks. Ayo lost time, money, and most importantly?trust.

Then he found @multibank_io.

Here was a hybrid platform that actually bridged the worlds he had once kept separate.
-Tokenized real estate and crypto? 
-Forex and commodities, fully regulated? 
-24/7 trading, staking rewards, and a stablecoin he could withdraw to a card? 

For the first time, Ayo didn’t need two screens or double the stress. One app, powered by real infrastructure, wrapped in $MBG, with all the tools of TradFi and the freedom of DeFi.

What to farm? Where to catch moves?

Sometimes the best trade isn’t a new token:  > it’s you <

That makes it the perfect time to sort out not just your portfolio, but your head too.

So today: not about new tokens or DeFi farming.

But about the basics that really bring you focus and energy to work when the market wakes up again.

> Here's how to get your energy and focus back <

What I personally chose to discard from my life and how it helped shape who I am today

1 > Cut the cheap dopamine
- Porn, TikTok, endless reels, background YouTube: all of it drains your charge.
- Save the reward for results: work first → fun later.

2 > Routine is your base
- You don’t sleep when you’re tired, you sleep when you should.
- Go to bed and wake up on a schedule, 7–8 hours, no screen in your face at night.
- Want a clear head? Let your body rest.

3 > No zombie mornings
- When you wake up, don’t scroll, move.
- Water, light exercise, cold shower, so your brain knows you’re alive.

4 > Less sugar & caffeine
- Sugar gives you a spike and crash.
- Coffee with no routine just makes you anxious.
- Stick to real food: meat, fats, spices, water. No random snacks.

5 > Move every day
- Not to get ripped for photos, but to pump your energy.
- Squats, walking, push-ups, whatever, while you move, your hormones work.

6 > Evening reality check
- Not “what I want”,  but “what I did.”
- 3 things you really did. 1 thing you avoided again.
- See where you lied to yourself, fix it tomorrow.

7 > Look at you, not them
- The mirror is better than stories.
- Who are you now? Who did you want to be?
- Answer with no excuses.

The system is simple: cut the junk → fix your routine → move → do the work.

Results don’t come from “motivation.”

They come from what you do, day after day.",Agri

2025-07-13 13:22:21+00:00,"Trump's horrific tariffs will hit the farming industry hard.

It will be much more expensive to produce agricultural products and selling them abroad will be more difficult.

Increased tariffs placed on farm goods like soybeans mean the amount of soybeans going to China will decrease and China will replace American soybeans with other countries.

Trump's tariffs will affect everything from fertilizers to farm equipment. Machinery costs will go up because farm equipment are made with foreign parts. 

Tariffs will increase farmers’ production costs, further squeezing already tight profit margins. 

Trump's tariffs come at a time when other support to farmers has been cut, stable and reliable export markets through the USAID program have been eliminated and federal funds have been frozen making farmers extremely uneasy.

Trump's America is a scared America.

To improve execution logic we explore to:

1. Analyze liquidity depth
2. Calculate market impact based on trade size vs. order book depth
3. Route smart execution:
   - Small orders (good liquidity) → Market orders
   - Large orders (thin liquidity) → TWAP

RWA tokenization is a big step forward. It’s not just another trend, it’s a true use case that brings real assets like houses, land, and even cars onto the blockchain. 

That means more people can invest, trade, and benefit from things that used to be out of reach.

Before, if you wanted to invest in real estate, you needed a lot of money. Now with tokenization, you can own just a small piece of property and still earn. That’s huge for normal people around the world.

And the fact that all of it is on-chain? Super transparent. No more guessing who owns what, or waiting for banks and agents to do paperwork. It’s fast, open, and global.

Plus, imagine using your tokenized car or house as collateral for a DeFi loan? That’s a real game-changer. Real assets, real yield — not just hype.

Big names like BlackRock and JPMorgan are already doing this. So the RWA movement is only getting stronger. I truly believe this is how blockchain becomes mainstream.

Overview:

Launched on November 17, 2015 by CBN under Late President Buhari, the Anchor Borrowers Program was established to boost agricultural production, reduce food imports, improve rural livelihoods,  promote food security and link Smallholder Farmers with Anchor Firms (Large-Scale Processors and Buyers) in Nigeria. 

Model: 

-The CBN provided single-digit loans (9% or less) to farmers through Deposit Money Banks (DMBs), Microfinance Banks (MFBs) and other financial institutions.
-Farmers received input support (seeds, fertilizers, agrochemicals) in kind, and to be paid after harvest
-Anchor firms (producers and large-scale buyers) guarantee offtake of produce, ensuring market access for farmers. 

Achievements: 

-Over N1.2 trillion disbursed (as at 2022)
-Over 4.8m smallholder farmers benefited from the program across the 36 states and FCT in Nigeria
-Over 30 commodities supported including rice, maize, wheat, cassava, sorghum, groundnut, etc. 
-About 5.2m hectares of land cultivated 
-over 10m direct and indirect jobs were estimated to be created.

Everyone talks about mobile money and apps.Few are talking about the fact that Africa:

✔️ Imports $50 billion in food annually.
✔️ Has 60% of the world’s uncultivated arable land.
✔️ Loses up to 40% of its harvest post-harvest due to poor storage and logistics.

We don’t have a farming problem.
We have a value chain problem.

The opportunity?
✔️ Build local processing industries.
✔️ Invest in cold storage and transport.
✔️ Empower smallholder farmers with finance and market access.

This is where Africa’s quiet giants are being made not just tech founders, but the people fixing the system beneath the surface.

https://t.co/xKDHKQwtJr
SisaJournal Reporter Joo Jae-han

Attention is growing over whether Bang Si-hyuk, chairman of HYBE, will become the de facto first target of the Lee Jae-myung administration’s policy crackdown on unfair practices in the capital market. This comes as the Capital Market Unfair Trade Response Task Force (TF) was officially launched on the 17th, just one day after the Financial Services Commission’s (FSC) Securities and Futures Commission filed a criminal complaint against Bang for violations of the Capital Markets Act.

The TF is a working-level consultative body formed to strengthen the system for responding to unfair trade crimes in the capital market and ensure prompt and fair investigations. It is led by the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office’s Anti-Corruption Department and includes working-level officials from the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office’s Financial and Securities Crimes Joint Investigation Unit, the FSC, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), and the Korea Exchange (KRX). The TF holds monthly meetings to coordinate enforcement and case responses.

While the TF’s main function is policy coordination and regulatory reform, it is also expected to discuss specific cases, especially those involving high-ranking executives or group heads. Because such cases require early coordination among agencies, they are likely to be brought to the table for serious discussion.

The Bang Si-hyuk case is expected to be handled by the Financial and Securities Crimes Joint Investigation Unit at the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office. The allegations include:

• Providing false information about plans to keep HYBE unlisted just prior to its IPO, and
• Selling shares to a private equity fund (PEF) founded by a HYBE executive and personally profiting from part of the margin.

The Securities and Futures Commission concluded these acts constituted fraudulent unfair trading under the Capital Markets Act and resolved to file a criminal complaint.

If these allegations are proven, Bang could face a minimum of five years in prison or even life imprisonment. Should the case proceed to a compulsory investigation, Bang would become the first chaebol-level figure to be investigated under the Yoon administration for violating the Capital Markets Act. This would serve as a symbolic litmus test for the administration’s pledged “One Strike Out” policy.

The TF is also expected to focus on ensuring the practical enforcement of strong sanctions introduced through the amendment of the Capital Markets Act, including:

• Freezing accounts used in unfair trading,
• Expelling violators from the market, and
• Imposing administrative fines.

The TF aims to establish practical cooperation mechanisms among agencies from the early stages of cases to ensure these systems function effectively in practice.

TF participants include key working-level officials from each agency:

• Lee Seung-hyung, Director of Anti-Corruption Division 1 at the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office,
• An Chang-joo, Head of the Financial and Securities Crimes Joint Investigation Unit at the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office,
• Shin Sang-rok, Director of the Capital Markets Investigation Division at the FSC,
• Kwon Young-bal, Director of Investigation Bureau 1 at the FSS, and
• Lee Jong-sang, Director of Review Division 1 at the KRX.

A representative from the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office stated:

“We will work closely with financial authorities from the early stages when signs of unfair trading are detected and do our utmost to ensure the effectiveness of the ‘One Strike Out for Stock Price Manipulation’ policy.”",Agri

Milkshake Finance is a fresh DeFi experience powered by @Agglayer VaultBridge and @katana , built on Ternoa.

We’re redefining how you farm, trade, and earn with stablecoins — through NFTs.

🚀 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗗𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗜𝘁 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸?
Every month, Milkshake Finance launches a Blend — a limited vault with a fixed number of spots.

Example:
🪐 Blend #1 – Milkyway
→ 100 spots only
→ $100 USDC per spot

Once you join a Blend, you instantly receive 2 NFTs:

🥤 Milkshake → Represents your Principal
🍒 Topping → Represents your Future Yield

💡 Let’s Break It Down

🥤 𝗠𝗶𝗹𝗸𝘀𝗵𝗮𝗸𝗲 = 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗮𝗹
Your funds are locked for a set period (e.g., 3 months)

During that time, it generates yield

At the end of the period, you can:

🔁 Keep your Milkshake and receive another Topping (new yield)

🔥 Burn it to get your full deposit back

So if you don’t burn, you get a new Topping every cycle (ex: every 3 months) — like passive farming with full flexibility.

🍒 𝗧𝗼𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴 = 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗙𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗬𝗶𝗲𝗹𝗱
Think of it as prepaid interest

It grows over the Blend period, powered by DeFi strategies (like Morpho)

Once the Blend ends, the Topping unlocks — and you can claim your yield

🔥 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗰 𝗼𝗳 𝗠𝗶𝗹𝗸𝘀𝗵𝗮𝗸𝗲
🎯 Both NFTs are tradable immediately after mint

→ Your future yield becomes liquid from day one
→ Traders can speculate, and farmers can optimize

👩‍🚀 𝗟𝗲𝘁’𝘀 𝗦𝗲𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗘𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀

𝗘𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝟭: Alice, the Farmer
Alice joins Milkyway Blend
→ Deposits $100 USDC
→ Gets 1 Milkshake + 1 Topping

She holds both.
3 months later:
→ Her Topping unlocks → She claims her $6 yield
→ She keeps her Milkshake → And receives another Topping
→ Yield keeps flowing every cycle!

𝗘𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝟮: Bob, the Trader
Bob buys a Topping on the marketplace for cheap
He knows the Blend ends soon
→ He waits and claims the full unlocked yield
→ High risk, high reward

𝗘𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝟯: Clara, the Optimizer
Clara joins Milkyway
She deposits $100
→ Receives Milkshake + Topping

She sends her Topping NFT to a vault on YieldFi on @katana 
→ That vault auto-compounds the Topping yield
→ Clara earns more, without touching her principal

🎯 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗠𝗶𝗹𝗸𝘀𝗵𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲?
✅ Future yield becomes tradable on day one
✅ Let users speculate on yield like never before
✅ Keep your principal safe and untouched
✅ Plug your NFTs into DeFi and boost your returns

Today, the Trump Administration announced a framework for an agreement on reciprocal trade with Indonesia. The deal will eliminate 99% of tariff barriers for a full range of U.S. food and ag products, unlocking market access for American farmers and producers.

In a statement, U.S. Grains Council President and CEO Ryan LeGrand said:

“The U.S. Grains Council commends the Trump Administration on its historic trade deal with Indonesia, that will enhance trade for both countries and places a zero tariff on the products the Council represents. In the 2023-24 marketing year, Indonesia was the fourth largest importer for U.S. distillers dried grains with solubles at 1,024,000 metric tons. That translates into a nearly $299 million market, and we hope the deal announced today will not only help see those numbers increase but open doors wider to the full range of products we have to offer.”",Agri

2025-07-24 17:56:29+00:00,"Hybra Finance @HybraFinance launched the “Community Pass” NFT collection today. The NFTs are tradable, and now you can buy or sell them on Drip Trade.

If you farm points on Hybra DEX, I suggest you buy an NFT because it gives a 20% points farming boost.

I think it’s worth the money. The floor price is 1.7 HYPE, which isn’t a lot if you are a serious farmer. If we assume that the points program will last until late August, this 20% boost can give you many additional points... IMO, it's a good investment.

Pay attention: This bonus doesn’t stack, meaning there is no reason to hold multiple NFTs. You will see the bonus in 24 hours after you purchase the NFT.

There is one downside: the collection will not have extra utility, so it will become useless once the points program is over. But as I said, you must have this NFT if you are a serious farmer. Getting a 20% points increase for 1.7 HYPE is super cheap.

dYdX is a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that offers margin trading, perpetual contracts, and lending/borrowing services. Its core strength lies in enabling users to trade with leverage in a decentralized and non-custodial manner.

📌dYdX and DeFi Yield Farming 
While initially known for trading, dYdX also integrates into yield farming ecosystems by facilitating various liquidity and collateral mechanisms, enabling users to optimize returns across multiple DeFi protocols.

📌The  Core of Yield Farming Synergies  
Yield farming involves lending, staking, or providing liquidity to earn interest or rewards. dYdX unlocks these opportunities by offering *margin lending* and *perpetual contracts*, enabling complex strategies such as leveraged yield farming.

📌Leveraged Yield Farming
Using dYdX, users can borrow assets to amplify their yield farming positions on other protocols like Uniswap, Curve, or Compound. For example, borrowing USDC on dYdX to provide liquidity on a stablecoin pool can generate higher yield.

📌Collateral Management & Risk Mitigation
dYdX’s advanced collateral management allows users to maintain diversified collateral, reducing liquidation

India and the UK signed a landmark Free Trade Agreement on 24th July 2025, unlocking significant new opportunities for India’s Agri and Processed Food sector.

With zero-duty access granted to over 95% of Indian tariff lines under HS Chapters 1–24, the FTA is set to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian agri-export stakeholders and is projected to boost exports by over 50% in the next 3 years.

Key Gains for Indian Exports include Fresh Grapes, Bakery Products (bread, pastries, cakes, Onions & Mixed Vegetables, Natural Honey, Preserved Fruits, Vegetables & Nuts, Processed Food Preparations, Sauces & Condiments

In a significant move, India has ensured the continued protection of its sensitive segments by excluding critical commodities like dairy, cereals (wheat, rice, millets, maize) and key fruits from tariff concessions.

The agreement adopts a strategic and phased liberalization approach—focusing on Value-Added Processed Products such as Preserved Cherries, Dried Apricots, Mango Slices in Brine and Prunes—while ensuring no adverse impact on domestic supply chains.

India–UK CETA brings Indian agri-products at par with major global suppliers, while reinforcing India’s position in premium export markets with quality, diversity and traceability.

Not a meme. Not a fork. Not your dusty farm 2.0.
This is @Ethereum_OS, and it’s changing the game. A living, breathing DeFi machine where users can farm, trade, burn, and earn real ETH just by holding one token: $EOS.

💎 The $EOS Token Your ETH Generator

Picture this. You hold $EOS and:
•You earn ETH from every transaction in the ecosystem
•You don’t stake. You don’t lock. You don’t wait.
•You just hold $EOS and ETH starts flowing in

The more action in the system, the more ETH hits your wallet.
It’s like passive income, but turbocharged.

🎮 A DeFi System That Feels Like a Game

This isn’t your average farm-and-dump.
It’s a smart, reflexive ecosystem with seven powerful mechanics:
1.Burn incentives that shrink supply
2.BOOST utility that increases yield and visibility
3.Seasonal loops that unlock higher reward potential
https://t.co/AHej9Gpiby rankings that spotlight active tokens
5.Deflation triggers that tighten supply as activity spikes
6.Built-in token creation tools so anyone can launch
7.ETH payouts tied directly to real trading volume

Everything feeds into everything else. The more users play, the more value flows through the system and into holders’ hands.

🔥 BOOST It and Reap More

Burning $EOS gives you BOOST, a power-up that:
•Raises your APY
•Helps promote your favorite tokens
•Pushes those tokens into the spotlight
•Drives even more trading and ETH payouts

It’s a self-sustaining flywheel with real ETH rewards at the center.

2025-07-29 14:49:19+00:00,"PEACH FARMING

Despite fetching good prices in the local and international markets, only a few farmers have embraced peach farming in Kenya.

 The fruit is essentially a luxury in most parts of the world. Kenya mainly exports peaches to Belarus, Rwanda, Singapore, and Somalia. 

They are extensively used in making juices, butter, topping for yogurt, waffles, ice cream, and as filling in pies and tarts. 

This shows that their demand is literary high. With few farmers growing the crop, the supply is still low. Why not take advantage of the market gap and leap from the lucrative Venture ?

In just two months, the Liberals posted a $6.5 billion deficit—a 71% jump from last year. Canadians are paying more in taxes than they spend on housing, food, and clothing combined—yet getting less in return.

Meanwhile, Mark Carney still hasn’t secured a trade deal with the U.S. despite making promise after promise. Tariffs are piling up. Jobs are at risk. Canadian industries are left in the dark.

Canadians are doing more than their fair share—it’s time the Liberals did the same.

🔵 Conservatives would:
✅ Cut waste, not services
✅ Impose dollar-for-dollar fiscal discipline
✅ Bring jobs and paycheques home
✅ Defend Canadian steel and workers

Common sense Conservatives will fix the budget and deliver results—because Canadians deserve better.

We are witnessing a shift to what is now called geoeconomics – the use of trade, investment, and tech as instruments of political power.

Here's what’s at risk:

🔹 Processed & packaged foods (Private labels)
🔹 Non-quota pork products (Already hit by China)
🔹 Lobster & seafood (Double pressure: U.S. + China)
🔹 Grain-based goods in steel/aluminum packaging
🔹 Whisky & beer 

But wait — even non-exported foods will cost more:

⚠️ Cans = pricier aluminum/steel
⚠️ Higher transport + storage costs
⚠️ Snacks/baked goods = costlier packaging
⚠️ Fresh produce = import frictions
⚠️ Restaurants = ingredient inflation

2025-08-02 12:16:36+00:00,"Prof Biswajit Dhar’s article in the Financial Express is very pertinent in the context of the ongoing tariffs imposed on us by Trump: 

“US farm subsidies, as reported to the WTO, are the highest in the world. These increased to $216 billion in 2022 from $61 billion in 1995. Subsidies have allowed producers of major commodities in the US to sell their products below their cost of production; in other words, US producers indulge in dumping. In the WTO, where negotiations for the reduction of tariffs and subsidies take place simultaneously—these two issues being the two “pillars” of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture—India has consistently argued that its tariff reduction would be subject to the US reducing its subsidies. Unfortunately, Trump’s unilateralism gives no opportunity to discuss the tariff-subsidy trade-off in the bilateral negotiations.

In fact, it was the US which taught India the costs of remaining dependent on food imports. During the India-Pakistan conflict in 1965, the US used wheat exports under PL-480 as a political tool to influence India’s policies. The then government decided to avoid the scourge of food import dependence and, therefore, being politically manipulated, by adopting the policy of self-sufficiency in foodgrains. This policy has remained a cornerstone of India’s agriculture policy over the past six decades.”",Agri

...Vows Continued Crackdown on Counterfeit Imports

The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Port Harcourt Area 1 Command, has handed over a major seizure of fake pharmaceutical products to the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), reinforcing the Service’s commitment to public health and safety.

According to a Press Release issued on Wednesday, 30 July 2025, by the Command's Public Relations Officer, Assistant Superintendent of Customs II, Jane Barilule, the Customs Area Controller (CAC), Comptroller Yola Hashim, described the seizure as a critical victory against those endangering Nigerian lives with fake drugs.

He noted that the interception occurred during a routine inspection of a 1x40-foot container falsely declared to be carrying motorcycle spare parts from China. Upon examination, officers uncovered 2,455 cartons of unregistered pharmaceutical products branded as Gebedol, concealed among 23 cartons of motorcycle spare parts and 12 bags with a duty-paid value of ₦3.29 million.

“Fake drugs kill,” he stated. “They destroy families, weaken our healthcare system, and pose a serious threat to national security. Those involved in such acts are no different from terrorists.”

He praised the officers' professionalism and noted the crucial role played by intelligence from sister agencies. He also highlighted the existing Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the NCS and NAFDAC as an effective framework for combating counterfeit imports.

The Customs Boss called for stronger collaboration among regulatory and security agencies to move from reactive seizures to proactive intelligence-led prevention.

In response, the Deputy Director of NAFDAC, Port Inspection Directorate, Adepoju Raufu, commended Customs for its vigilance and swift response, stressing that the counterfeit products could have inflicted serious harm if allowed into circulation. He assured stakeholders that NAFDAC would commence immediate investigation, oversee the destruction of the consignment, and track the perpetrators behind the importation.

Raufu reaffirmed NAFDAC’s commitment to safeguarding public health and deepening collaboration with the Nigeria Customs Service and other enforcement bodies.

The event, attended by representatives from NDLEA, DSS, Immigration, Quarantine Service, and freight forwarding associations, concluded with the formal handover of the seized items to NAFDAC.",Agri

Paying inflated prices for fuel? Purchasing overpriced military hardware with zero technology transfer? Opening our markets to substandard goods and toxic agri-imports? Signing trillion-dollar investment commitments that often resemble charity, extortion, or worse—strategic dependency?

In that context, a high tariff suddenly looks like a rational option.

Why are we still chasing elusive ‘deals’ with a historically antagonistic power? Instead of pouring time and energy into negotiations that yield diminishing returns, it would be far more prudent to initiate meaningful, strategic dialogue with China.

If Russia and China—despite their own long-standing territorial disputes—can find functional, cooperative ground, why not India and China?

Ironically, what Biden managed to do with Russia and China, Trump may end up replicating with India and China. The world might eventually get a reimagined RIC, a stronger BRICS, and perhaps, finally, a SAFE PLACE AGAIN.

The Indo-US relationship is best sustained through a time-tested people-to-people framework—not burdened by transactional compulsions masquerading as strategic ties.

• Traditional funding farming requires capital to be locked in spot + perp
• Boros decouples the yield from the position
• Yield Units (YUs) tokenize future funding rate flows
• LPs and traders can trade funding risk, not take directional bets

➤ You don’t commit capital. You free it.

Composable Liquidity Layer

Boros is designed to make funding rate yield composable and tradable:

• YUs can be minted permissionlessly and redeemed on maturity
• LPs provide liquidity on YU pairs (Long/Short)
• Traders buy/sell YU to express rate outlooks
• Protocols can integrate YUs into vaults, fixed income, or hedging strategies

➤ Liquidity becomes programmable → capital becomes efficient

Use Case Examples (locked yield → tradable asset)

• Fixed Yield Vault
→ Vault buys YU below par → earns predictable yield
• Hedged Liquidity
→ LP short YU + long perp → lock in known PnL window
• Funding Index Derivatives
→ Create synthetic funding exposure via basket of YUs
• Structured Products
→ Build RWA-style tranches from YU sets with different maturity profiles

➤ Pick a structure. Boros gives you the yield primitive.

Yield is no longer passive or hidden.

These aren’t just random tokens. They both pumped ~9% after the listing news, and now trade with up to 50x leverage on Binance Futures.

Let’s break it down, properly ⬇️

♡ YALA
A Bitcoin-native liquidity protocol.
You can earn yield on your BTC no wrapping, no selling.
Before this listing, YALA sat at just a $45M market cap.
Then Binance launched perps → price spiked immediately.

♡ CARV
Think: modular identity & data layer for Web3, gaming & AI.
Designed for both humans and AI agents to manage and monetize data sovereignty.
TGE was only 8 months ago. Market cap was ~$80M pre-listing.
Also jumped ~9% on the Binance news.

♡ Why This Matters
Binance delisted MEMEFI futures yesterday.
Today, they list two low caps with strong fundamentals and active narratives:
BTC infra (YALA) + AI/Data infra (CARV).
This isn’t noise it’s a signal.

♡ What We’re Seeing
Binance has been subtle about it, but the rotation is real.
Low-cap tokens with real use cases are making their way to Futures.
The ones getting leverage exposure are being handpicked.

This move feels early.
And early is where the edge lives.

✍️ Conclusion:

From 2012 to now, one thing stays true:
When Binance gives 50x leverage to under-$100M caps, it’s not for fun it’s because they see momentum early.

Watch low caps.
Watch narratives.
Binance just gave you the play.

2025-08-09 13:55:46+00:00,"Bouquinistes of Paris, France, are second-hand and antiquarian booksellers who trade along large stretches of the banks of the Seine: on the right bank from Pont Marie to the Quai du Louvre and on the left bank from Quai de la Tournelle to Quai Voltaire. 
The Seine has thus been described as ""the only river in the world that flows between two bookshelves"". 
The tradition of second-hand booksellers began around the 16th century with small market traders. Under pressure from booksellers, the town of 1649 banned stalls displaying books on the Pont Neuf. 
The authorities at the time were quite concerned to restrict parallel markets that were not subject to official censorship. Traveling booksellers during the period were expelled and then reinstated after approval. 
The traditional emblem of the bouquinistes is a ""lizard looking at a sword"". 
 In 1859, the city of Paris granted concessions and bouquinistes were allowed to set up shop in certain locations. 
Each was entitled to 10 meters of railing for an annual fee of 26.35 F and a license of 25 F. The openings were from sunrise to sunset. 
Finally, in 1930, the dimensions of the ""boxes"" were fixed. 
Installed more than three kilometers from the Seine and declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the 240 bouquinistes use 900 ""green boxes"" to house around 300,000 old books and a very large number of diaries, stamps and trading cards.

Yet, when it came to industrial reforms, we waited until the Balance of Payments Crisis of 1991 to act. Similarly, it took the collapse of the Soviet Union before we pivoted decisively toward Western markets and global integration. More recently, our withdrawal from the RCEP in 2019 should have been a wake-up call to strengthen the competitiveness of both our agrarian and industrial sectors. Likewise, the Trump administration’s withdrawal of India’s GSP benefits during his first term should have signaled the risk of harsher tariffs ahead.

The underlying reason for these missed opportunities is inertia — a lack of long-term strategic vision to address our structural weaknesses. Instead, we have relied on episodic, ad hoc, and knee-jerk responses. One hopes that the threat of Trump’s tariffs will finally prompt our leadership and bureaucracy to craft a coherent, forward-looking strategy that makes India genuinely competitive in global markets.
Relying on the United States or any other external partner to revive our manufacturing and industrial capacity is nothing more than building castles in the air.

2025-08-10 06:53:58+00:00,"Why Indian Farmers needs to be shielded 

1. India maintains high tariffs (around 40.2% weighted average) on food imports to shield farmers from cheaper international prices, as domestic prices for major crops like soybean oil and sunflower seeds are 2-4 times higher due to subsidies pulling down global rates.

2. Indian farmers face challenges from lower yields compared to top producers; for example, wheat yield in India is 3.5 tons/ha versus 5.8 in China, and rice yield is 4.3 tons/ha versus 7.1 in the US.

3. Despite low yields in crops like pigeon peas and chickpeas, India is a top producer, but advanced countries like Vietnam and Indonesia outperform in specific items, highlighting productivity gaps.

4. Agriculture employs 44% of India's workforce but contributes only 16.4% to GVA, with farmers receiving negative financial support (-42% of gross farm receipts) unlike positive subsidies in countries like China (310%) and the US (135%).

5. Global subsidies distort international prices, limiting Indian exports and making imports a threat; without protection, massive unemployment could disrupt food security, as emphasized by PM Modi's commitment to prioritizing farmers' interests.",Agri

If Russia doesn’t end the war in Ukraine soon, there is a growing expectation that President Trump’s secondary tariff policy will expand beyond India — and thanks to Lula’s repeated missteps, Brazil is squarely in the crosshairs.

The numbers are stark. Per the Financial Times, Brazil’s imports of Russian diesel have rocketed from $95M in 2022 to $5.4B in 2024, making it the world’s #2 buyer after Turkey.

But this isn’t just about trade flows. Lula has:

•Pushed relentlessly to weaken the dollar via BRICS

•Tilted commerce and diplomacy toward China over the U.S. 

•Embraced Alexandre de Moraes’s aggressive censorship campaign against political opponents and U.S. platforms

The result is a frayed relationship with Washington at the worst possible time, and a looming risk of secondary tariffs that could hit the diesel fueling Brazil’s trucks and tractors, and other imports keeping its agribusiness competitive.

Lula’s foreign policy has set the stage for a perfect storm.

2025-08-14 15:31:05+00:00,"Boros has been live for just a week, and the market signal is already loud.

Here's what I've noticed 🔥

This isn’t another DeFi farm. It’s the first on-chain market for perpetual funding rates, a $150–200B/day flow between longs and shorts that, until now, nobody could trade or hedge directly.

In its first 24h:
→ ETH funding exposure repeatedly hit its cap, forcing multiple increases
→ Vault cap now $180K, open interest up to $30M
→Demand led by institutions & protocols using Boros to hedge, not speculate

Case in point: @ethena_labs. With $9.7B running a delta-neutral strategy, they’ve historically relied on favorable funding rates to boost yield. @boros_fi now lets them lock fixed APRs on shorts during negative periods, smoothing revenue, reducing redemption risk, and keeping yields stable for partners.

From @caladanxyz’s view, this is the start of crypto’s fixed-income market.

No scalable funding hedge exists in TradFi or DeFi,  Boros is first-mover. The fact that caps were smashed in days shows the demand was always there; it just needed the infrastructure.

Week one proved the market exists. The next phase is scaling it.

I'm betting Boros becomes the standard for funding rate trading across crypto. Higher. 🔥",Agri

Though Prof. Swaminathan collaborated with multiple distinguished leaders and organizations and was recognized with numerous awards and accolades, including the World Food Prize and the Padma Vibhushan, he continued to give importance to working with and the empowerment of farmers, coastal fishers, and rural and marginalized communities. His tireless work led him to the idea of the 'Evergreen Revolution': of balancing agricultural development with ecological sustainability. He also coined the term 'Biohappiness', which describes harmony achieved through agricultural progress, biodiversity, and social and gender equity.

Prof. Swaminathan's vision and contributions continue to be a beacon of learning and inspiration, guiding key research and groundwork in science, policy and agriculture.

2. Vertical Integration: Controlling raw materials and logistics to cut costs.

3. Local Production: Reducing import reliance, aligning with Nigeria’s industrialization policies. He was still operating in the sectors he has been buying and selling. 

4. Diversification: Expanding into cement, food, energy, and more to mitigate risks. He was successful in one before expanding to others. 

5. Resilience: Overcoming currency fluctuations, regulatory hurdles, and competition. 

6. Philanthropy and Influence: Through the Dangote Foundation (est. 1994), he’s invested in health, education, and poverty alleviation. Don't let anybody gaslight you into generosity before you are ready.

We cannot be dependent on imports because kung biglang tumaas yan, food security ang challenge. Kung mataas ang supply, mataas ang presyo ng bigas at pag mataas ang presyo ng bigas, ang kapalit nyan ay gutom sa milyon-milyon nating kababayan.

Pag food insecure ang ating mga kababayan, you cannot hope to be as productive. Hindi dapat inaccessible, expensive.

Kaya talaga ang pinaka-weakest link sa agriculture supply is the farmer and therefore if the farmer is the weakest link then the farmer must have the biggest support to be able to strengthen the farmers and fisherfolk, and that’s what we’re going to work on.

2025-08-18 22:07:01+00:00,"💲 Tariffs and the Food Cost Squeeze

The National Restaurant Association warns that new tariffs—up to 50% on imports from 60+ countries and 35% on Canadian goods—could push wholesale food prices far beyond the current 5% annual rise.

For restaurants, already operating on razor-thin margins, this may force menu price increases—risking lower customer traffic and reduced access to dining options.

This isn’t just a restaurant issue—seen through an RDN and systems leadership lens, the ripple effects touch every corner of our food system:
🏛 Public procurement – Schools, hospitals, and other institutions face the same cost pressures, often with even less flexibility to pass costs along.
🥗 Menu planning – Higher ingredient costs can push organizations toward less nutrient-dense, lower-cost items if wellness goals aren’t protected.
🌍 Supply chain strategy – This is a call to diversify sourcing, strengthen local supplier networks, and evaluate contract language for tariff impacts.

Leadership takeaway:

Food cost volatility isn’t just an economic challenge—it’s a nutrition and equity challenge. Leaders in both public and private sectors must plan now to protect access, quality, and health outcomes.

In Web3, gaming, streaming, and blockchain are colliding, and @TheAndrometa is where it all comes together. This isn’t just a game, it’s a full-blown social gaming universe where players can play, stream, trade, and actually own their digital world.

🌌 What is Andrometa?

Andrometa is the first on-chain social gaming platform, fusing immersive anime-inspired gameplay with VTubing and peer-to-peer digital asset trading.

Powered by proprietary 3D avatars and hardware-free AI motion capture (patent pending), it lets anyone create, play, and broadcast, all from one integrated platform.

 Why It’s Different

  • Dual-purpose avatars: The same character you battle with in-game can double as your VTuber persona for live streaming.

  • AI motion capture: Full-body tracking without expensive rigs, cutting VTubing costs by up to 95%.

  • True ownership: Players trade, earn, and control assets directly on-chain.

This blend of gaming + content creation breaks barriers, lowering costs, boosting accessibility, and giving players and creators the tools to engage audiences like never before.

let’s talk about how new tools reshape our actions in Web3.

before metamask, diving into DeFi or NFTs was a struggle as they  stayed on centralized exchanges.

then MetaMask arrived. suddenly, millions could swap, stake, mint, and trade without needing deep technical skills. It became the essential gateway to Web3.

why the shift? behavior changed.

wallets once felt intimidating.

now they are daily essentials. the competitive edge was too significant to ignore.

Elon Musk’s X has just dropped a political thunderbolt: it formally submitted evidence to the U.S. Trade Representative under Section 301, detailing how Brazil’s judicial strongman tactics are suffocating free speech and hammering U.S. digital platforms.

The filing isn’t polite legalese—it’s an indictment. @X accuses Brazil of weaponizing state power against the platform, flagging actions and policies that directly sabotage U.S. companies operating there. In plain terms: censorship dressed up as “lawfare” isn’t just killing free expression, it’s also a trade violation.

The comments sent to Washington stress two explosive points:
1.Freedom of expression under siege – Brazil’s crackdown is targeting political speech online, creating a chilling effect across the digital sphere.
2.Unfair trade practices – By bullying U.S. platforms into compliance, Brazil is tilting the playing field in favor of its political agenda while undermining American businesses.

And here’s the kicker: once the USTR has this kind of ammunition on record, scrutiny is not optional—it’s baked in. Section 301 exists to punish unfair trade practices, and Brazil just got its name etched onto the watchlist.

X didn’t just call out the abuse—it put the question squarely before Washington: will the U.S. defend its own companies, or let Brazil’s censors set the rules of the game?",Agri

Monad’s choice to be 100% EVM compatible is deliberate. Instead of reinventing the wheel, the team builds on a widely adopted standard, ensuring:

Seamless integration with existing Ethereum tools, wallets, and dApps

Faster adoption since developers don’t need to learn a new environment

Improved performance by optimizing the EVM rather than replacing it

This approach combines the best of both worlds: familiarity for developers and users, with meaningful improvements under the hood.

Everybody wants that next big drop.

But few people actually look at the mechanics behind it.

Let’s talk about @Ostrich_HQ the CEX-style exchange that’s playing the game differently.

Here’s how it works:

✦ You trade on Ostrich (spot, perp, etc.)
✦ You earn Points
✦ 1M Points are distributed weekly
✦ After 8 weeks → Points convert into $RICH 💎

Simple. Clean. Direct.

But why is this different?

Most exchanges throw random campaigns with confusing rules.
Ostrich is making it predictable:
→ Consistent point system
→ Clear time frame (8 weeks)
→ Conversion into an actual token.

No smoke & mirrors.

Right now, the market meta is crowded with fake “testnet hype” & projects farming users.

Ostrich reward users for real usage.
Not for endless quests, not for botted likes but for actually trading.

And let’s talk numbers.

Imagine:
300k active users like Union
Even if each does just 5 trades/day with average fees… that’s millions flowing.

That’s the kind of traction that doesn’t just make users rich…
…it makes the project sustainable.

Campaigns like this don’t last forever.
This 1M Points drop is running weekly for 8 weeks.

Do the math → if you miss the early rounds, you’re farming diluted rewards later.

In short:

→ Trade.
→ Earn Points.
→ Points → $RICH.
→ Early farmers eat best.

That’s it.

The Ostrich flywheel is simple, but sometimes the simplest mechanics win the hardest.

Campaign is LIVE now.

DeFi has unlocked new ways to trade, lend, and invest but it’s been mostly limited to digital-native tokens. Real-world markets like property, bonds, and commodities have remained out of reach.

Mavryk changes that.
It’s a Layer 1 blockchain designed specifically for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. With Mavryk, assets such as real estate, bonds, commodities, or even digital ETFs can be represented directly on-chain.

This unlocks:

Liquidity → Assets that normally take weeks to trade can move instantly.

Accessibility → Markets that were once reserved for institutions become open to anyone.

Transparency → On-chain representation makes ownership and transfers verifiable.

Beyond RWAs, Mavryk introduces core innovations:

Liquid Proof of Stake (LPoS): Enhanced security + better capital efficiency.

Forkless Governance: Upgrades happen without network splits.

Keyless Wallets: Simplifying user experience without sacrificing safety.

The end goal is clear: a truly global financial system one where traditional assets flow seamlessly into DeFi, giving people everywhere the chance to participate.

You've staked your SOL. You’re excited. Rewards are coming in.
But then an opportunity pops up... an airdrop, a new farm or even a trade.

You check your wallet, your SOL is locked, you can’t move.

But then you have $mSol

What exactly is mSol?

mSOL is born the moment you stake SOL through Marinade Finance.

Think of it as your SOL’s twin except this twin can walk, run, and travel through DeFi…
while the original stays home, safely earning rewards.

With mSOL, you’re never stuck.
Your SOL keeps earning staking yield.
Your mSOL keeps moving freely.

Stake once, but live twice.

The beauty?
mSOL doesn’t just sit idle, it grows.

Every day, its value inches higher compared to SOL.
Because inside it, staking rewards are quietly compounding.

It’s like carrying a purse that fills itself while you walk.

And when you’re ready to return?
You don’t wait 2–3 days to unstake.

You just swap mSOL instantly back to SOL.
No delays. No locked funds.

The magic of it generally is:
mSOL opens doors.

• You can lend it.
• Provide liquidity.
• Farm with it.
• Use it as collateral.

Your SOL earns in the background…
while your mSOL earns in the foreground.

So what is mSOL?

It’s not just a token.
It’s freedom.
Your SOL, unstuck.
Your yield, untouched.

Effective August 29, 2025, the United States government has removed the de minimis exemption. All shipments to the US must now clear customs, and shipments originating from Canada will face a flat 35% tariff.

As a result of this change, and to avoid imposing unreasonable duty charges on both our customers and the store, we will be pausing all orders and shipments to the US, including both new and existing pre-orders. Pre-order periods for current and upcoming drops will be extended to compensate for the lost time.

During this pause, we are actively working with multiple logistics partners to identify a sustainable path forward and aim to restore regular service as soon as possible.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and delays this may cause, especially for existing orders and in-transit US shipments that could face unforeseen issues at customs. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to resolve this matter. 🙇‍♂️

🚩Effective today (August 29), the U.S. indefinitely suspends the $800 de minimis duty exemption on low‑value imports, subjecting all shipments to customs duties.

👉🏼The “de minimis duty exemption” is a rule that lets people in the U.S. order goods worth under $800 from abroad (Amazon, Shopify, Shein, Temu, etc.) without paying customs duties or extra processing fees. 

🚩Under the new rule, all international packages—even those valued under $800—are now subject to import charges. 

Here’s how it works: 
👉🏼 Option 1 - Ad valorem duty: Calculated as a percentage of the item’s declared value (based on the origin country’s IEEPA tariff rate). - applies after February 

👉🏼Option 2 - A fixed charge of $80 to $200 per package, depending on the country of origin.

Flat Fee Tiers (Postal Shipments):
•$80 per package for countries with tariffs below 16%
•$160 per package for countries with tariffs between 16–25%
•$200 per package for countries with tariffs above 25%

More like fuck over workers first. 

This is how this moron did it:

• Farmers gutted. His 2018 tariffs triggered Chinese retaliation that wiped out $27 billion in farm exports in just two years. Soybeans collapsed. Market share in China gone. Bankruptcies up 20–24% in 2019, the highest since 2011. He handed out bailout checks like opioids, but the damage was permanent.

• Manufacturing jobs lost, not gained. Fed research is clear: tariff exposure reduced manufacturing employment. Any gains for steel mills were crushed by retaliation and higher input costs. Producer prices up, workers down.

• Autos bled dry. Ford ate $1 billion in higher costs. GM lost another $1 billion. Harley-Davidson faced EU duties up to 31%, got hammered, and shifted production overseas. U.S. plants and suppliers took the hit.

• Solar industry kneecapped. His 2018 solar tariffs killed 62,000 jobs that could have been created, cut 10.5 GW of clean power, and drained $19 billion in investment. All so panels cost more for U.S. consumers.

•Appliances—workers and consumers robbed. Washing machine tariffs jacked washer and dryer prices 12% across the board. Americans paid $1.5 billion more a year for the privilege. That’s $820,000 per job created. Retail and demand shrank.

• Overtime pay gutted. Obama’s 2016 rule would’ve covered 8 million more workers. Trump slashed it down. The “deal-maker” literally canceled overtime protection for millions of salaried workers.

• Federal workers used as pawns. His 2018–19 shutdown—the longest in U.S. history—furloughed 340,000 workers and left federal contractors unpaid. Airports, ports, and local economies all got hammered.

• Lobstermen screwed. Maine lobster exports collapsed under Chinese tariffs. Processors, truckers, and coastal communities took the blow.

So here’s your “America First”:
Farmers bankrupt, autoworkers shafted, solar killed, overtime gutted, federal workers used as bargaining chips. The only thing Trump’s tariffs reliably created? Layoffs, bankruptcies, and higher prices for the very people he claimed to protect.

The questions took centre-stage at the Africa Food Systems Forum (@TheAGRF) in Dakar on 2 Sep., with the @AfCFTA Agri-Trade Action Plan in the spotlight. The plan identifies seven high-potential value chains—rice, fish, palm oil, fruits, vegetables, meat and maize—and sets out how to move them from policy ambition to practical market access.

Success, panellists agreed, will depend on how quickly countries can cut trade barriers, align standards and design sustainable programmes. TradeMark Africa’s @AntheVrijlandt underscored three priorities: digitising SPS and customs systems, catalysing investment in youth-led enterprises, and ensuring women and young people capture real benefits—building on initiatives like the AfCFTA–Mastercard Foundation–TMA Fisheries programme.

Lead; Gerald Masila, CEO, @EAGrainCouncil; Watipaso Mkandawire (Regional Food Trade Adviser, @FCDOGovUK; & @BaboucarrManne8, DG @AfricaRice & @CGIAR Regional Director, West &  Central Africa, emphasised the importance of creating an enabling environment by phasing out tariffs & NTBs & addressing SPS challenges to fast-track regional value chain development and advance the industrialisation of food production and distribution.

""...when trade policy becomes more uncertain, firms in industries that are more exposed to international trade reshore production to a greater extent and automate more than those that are less exposed. This boosts labor productivity but results in little change in employment relative to firms in less exposed industries, likely because automation has both job-creating and job-displacing effects. Given the macro-level evidence that trade policy uncertainty reduces investment and production, our results suggest that automation may mitigate those negative effects for firms that are more dependent on international trade.""

2025-09-06 20:18:31+00:00,"I used to hate staking.
Yeah, the rewards were cool… but my tokens were basically locked in prison. Couldn’t trade, couldn’t farm, couldn’t move. Just sit & wait.

Then I came across @Bifrost and it completely changed how I look at staking.
When I stake, I actually get vTokens (like vDOT, vETH, vKSM). They still earn yield, but I can also use them in DeFi — swap, lend, even play around in other ecosystems.

It feels like my assets finally got freedom. 

What really stood out for me:
•SLPx: staking that’s omnichain-native (no clunky bridges)
•LoopStake: one-click leverage staking that compounds automatically
•bbBNC: profit-sharing → 90% to holders, 10% burned
•Security: audits, MEV protection, controlled slippage

And the numbers prove it’s not just hype:
→ $64M+ locked
→ 8.5M vDOT minted
→ vASTR up 38% MoM
→ Hyperbridge pushing vTokens onto Base, Arbitrum, Optimism & BNB Chain

The coolest part? It’s not only for DeFi degens like me.
•Apps can integrate staked assets directly
•AI agents can automate staking strategies
•Games can use yield-bearing tokens
•Even enterprises get liquid, compliant treasuries

For me, Bifrost isn’t just “a staking protocol.” It feels like the infrastructure that’s making Web3 liquidity actually usable.

Staking doesn’t have to feel like being locked up anymore. With Bifrost, it finally feels alive.

I’ve staked before… but it always felt like my tokens were stuck in a cage.

With Bifrost, it’s different. 
I stake → I get vTokens → I still earn + stay liquid in DeFi.
No more waiting. No more missed opportunities.

If you’re staking and your assets aren’t moving with you, you’re doing it wrong.

2025-09-06 20:25:57+00:00,"Foreign Trade and Inflation: How Global Prices Affect Your Wallet 🌏

Foreign trade connects every corner of the world. When a country imports goods like food, fuel, or raw materials, the prices of those products are influenced by global markets—not just local conditions.

This is where inflation comes in. If the cost of wheat rises in one part of the world, bread prices can go up everywhere. Similarly, when fuel prices spike globally, transportation and logistics costs increase, making nearly everything more expensive.

Foreign trade acts as both a bridge and a buffer. On one hand, global demand and supply can push prices higher. On the other hand, trade also offers access to alternative suppliers, helping countries stabilize costs and avoid shortages.

For investors, this means inflation isn’t just a domestic issue—it’s global. That’s why blockchain-backed trade solutions like $EXIM are critical. By making international trade more transparent, efficient, and cost-effective, they help reduce the hidden costs that drive inflation and protect both businesses and consumers.",Agri

Africa spends over $50 billion annually on food imports—a figure projected to exceed $110 billion by 2030 if trends continue. This dependence is unsustainable in light of global demographic and economic shifts. Europe is ageing, farmland is shrinking under urbanisation, and farm labour is declining. Africa must rise as the next global food powerhouse.
History provides clear lessons. The agricultural revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe—driven by innovations such as Jethro Tull’s seed drill—created rural surpluses that fuelled industrialisation and trade integration. Germany leveraged robust agricultural productivity to open markets; France’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) after WWII secured food stability and export growth; the Netherlands built a world-class agribusiness sector through efficiency and cooperative farming.

 If you burn through food without planning, you’ll be forced to scramble later. If you overuse rare materials, you might miss the chance to craft something valuable.

 The game pushes you to think carefully, to plan ahead, and to balance your short-term needs with long-term growth.

Scarcity also makes cooperation more meaningful. Trading with other players, sharing what you have, or working together to gather supplies becomes part of the adventure.

 It turns survival into something bigger than just your character, it becomes about how well you manage resources as a team.

At its heart, @LumiterraGame teaches that survival isn’t just about fighting or farming.

 It’s about making smart decisions when resources are limited, and building strategies that keep you moving forward no matter what.",Agri

Most DeFi projects circle around speculation — staking, farming, looping. But what if those same tools were applied to something concrete like cargo shipments or raw materials?

With $IOTA, you can collateralize a shipment of copper, tokenize it, and let financiers provide liquidity instantly. Gas Station support means businesses interact as if it were feeless, while still securing the network through normal fees (near feeless).

Companies like @Glencore , @RioTinto , or @BASF spend millions annually on trade finance fees. Replacing that with automated settlement on IOTA isn’t just disruption — it’s transformation.

“India has 1.4 billion people but won’t buy our corn 🌽, refuses to lower tariffs — if this continues, India will face tough times.”

What does this really mean?

➡️ Washington expected India to surrender its food market

➡️ Pressure tactics to dismantle farmer security & self-reliance

➡️ But Modi Govt stood firm, refusing to compromise farmers’ interests at the cost of American corporate lobbies

Not for sale.

Start with LumiTown.
It’s the heart of the game, the place where players meet, trade, and gear up.
From here, you can head out to farms, battlefields, or fishing spots across the map.

Fishing is one of the newest and most exciting updates.
The map is huge, and there are different places to cast your line.
Every catch has value whether you use it for quests, trades, or crafting.

Then there’s farming.
It’s not just about planting seeds, it’s about strategy.
You manage your time, resources, and land to get the best harvest.

Crafting ties it all together.
The tools, weapons, and gear you make aren’t just for show they help you survive, grow, and push further into the world.

And we can’t forget skins and costumes.
They make Lumiterra fun and personal.
Everyone can show off their style while they grind or explore.

But the real magic is the community.
Guilds, late night farming runs, sharing tips, even joking about lemons that’s what makes Lumiterra feel alive.

That’s why Lumiterra stands out.
It’s not just about grinding; it’s about building, exploring, and shaping the world together.

🌾 Indian Agri & Food Processing – Resilient, Growing & Financing-Ready 🌾
India’s agri-related sector is powering ahead despite global turbulence. With exports of $53 billion in FY24–25, packaged foods growing at 14% CAGR, and demand expanding from the Middle East to Africa, the sector is at a pivotal growth stage.
But growth is not without challenges:
 ⚠️ Tariff shocks – US reciprocal tariffs at 50% are eroding competitiveness in spices, basmati, and processed foods.
 ⚠️ Logistics & cold chain costs – Perishable exporters lose billions annually due to infrastructure gaps.
 ⚠️ Tight cash cycles – Farmers, processors, and exporters face 90–120 day receivable delays.
 ⚠️ Procurement pressure – Thousands of smallholder farmers need timely payments, straining processors’ liquidity.
💡 Opportunities are equally powerful:
 ✔️ Rising global demand for organic & sustainable products.
 ✔️ Cold chain investments offering new B2B ventures.
 ✔️ Ready-to-eat packaged foods gaining international shelf space.
 ✔️ Domestic consumption surging via e-commerce and modern retail.

2025-09-19 14:20:58+00:00,"Freedom Friday | Women and Financial Freedom

In Africa, women have always been at the center of trade and survival. From the market stalls in Lagos and Kumasi, to women selling food by the roadside in Nairobi, to mothers saving little by little to send their children to school women carry the weight of families and communities.

But many times, the money system doesn’t work for them.
🔶 Some women cannot open bank accounts because of requirements they cannot meet.
🔶 Savings are eaten up by inflation. What can buy a bag of rice today, buys half tomorrow.

This is not just about money. It is about freedom.

And this is where Bitcoin comes in. 

Bitcoin gives women a way to save, trade, and earn without waiting for permission.
🔶 A device is enough to start. No need for papers or banks.
🔶 She can receive payment directly from anyone, anywhere, without delay.
🔶 Her savings are protected from inflation, because Bitcoin cannot be printed endlessly.
🔶 She can earn in Bitcoin by selling, working, or even offering services online.

Think about a market woman in Lagos: instead of holding naira that loses value daily, she can save part of her earnings in Bitcoin and protect her future. Or a mother in Nairobi receiving money from her daughter abroad instantly, without high remittance fees.

This is the kind of empowerment that changes not just one life, but an entire family and community.

As the African saying goes: “When you educate a woman, you educate a nation.”

Bitcoin is not just technology. It is a new tool of freedom, one that gives women across Africa the power to control their money, their choices, and their future.

Managing liquidity and future yields in yield farming can be a bit tricky.

Pendle solves this problem smartly.
This protocol tokenizes your future yield.

Meaning: You can trade by changing the future rewards of your LP tokens to the upfront value.

➥ How it works:
• LP tokens are divided into two parts → Ownership token (OT) and Yield token (YT)
• Liquidity can be taken immediately by trading YT
• It becomes easier to customize risk and return

➥ Why it is important:
• Better use of liquidity
• Easy to hedge the risk
• New tool for passive earners

Pendle is unique in DeFi, as it gives the option to monetize future cashflows.

Long-term yield strategies and capital efficiency can have a strong impact.

If you want to explore smarter yield strategies in crypto, then Pendle is definitely worth checking.

Most Web3 games talk about ownership, but LumiTerra actually builds it into the core gameplay. 🌱

Players don’t just grind for items. they farm, craft, and trade assets that exist fully on-chain. Land upgrades, crops, and tools become part of a persistent economy where effort translates into real value.

This creates two layers of play:
🎮 A fun, strategy-driven farming sim.
🌐 An economic layer where assets have liquidity, scarcity, and player-driven markets.

The result? A game that feels engaging and sustainable, with a player-owned economy that can outlast traditional closed systems.

2025-09-23 15:16:26+00:00,"DeFi has unlocked endless ways to trade, lend, and farm - but one primitive has been missing: a real market for risk itself.

That’s what Re is building. Not “insurance wrappers” or legacy models ported onchain - but a liquid marketplace where risk is:
• Issued onchain as transparent coverage
• Enforced automatically through smart contracts
• Tradable just like any other asset

Why does this matter?
→ Protocols can instantly protect their users, reducing systemic blowups.
→ Capital providers get access to yields from real risk markets, not just emissions.
→ Traders & LPs can hedge exposure as easily as they swap tokens.

The breakthrough is simple but powerful:
Risk stops being a black box. It becomes a priced, transparent, and composable asset.

That means DeFi doesn’t just copy TradFi insurance - it creates something stronger: a foundation where risk itself can be measured, traded, and integrated into strategies.

When risk becomes liquid, every protocol, every investor, and every trader gains a new tool:
Not just protection. Not just coverage.
But a market that makes DeFi more resilient, more capital-efficient, and built to last.

→ So the question is:
If risk was as easy to trade as ETH or AVAX, how would you use it?",Agri

Let’s break down how XLaunch works: how to earn points
By trading on-chain using the OKX Wallet, you can earn points. The more you trade, the more points you get.

Daily trading volume counts up to $4,096, with a maximum of 8 points.

Unlike Binance Alpha, there’s no minimum points requirement here— even 1 point can earn you rewards.

Reward formula:

Reward = (Individual points ÷ Total points) × Total prize pool for the period
So, the more points you have, the larger your share of the prize pool.

💰 Cost analysis: trading fees

OKX Wallet trading fee: 0.85%

If you trade the full $4,096 daily for 15 days, the fees would be about $522.

Using a referral code can give you 20% off fees, reducing it to $417—a saving of over $100.

Slippage cost:

For mainstream coins (BTC, ETH, UNI, etc.), the point coefficient is only 0.25×, so you can’t reach full points.

To earn maximum points, you need to trade smaller coins or “meme” coins, which have low liquidity and higher slippage.

Slippage can range from 0.3%–3% or even higher—this is the second biggest cost.

🛠️ Tips to reduce costs:

1. Use a referral code: 20% off fees, saving over $100.

2. Pick trading pairs wisely: Avoid overly mainstream coins (low points) and extremely illiquid coins (high slippage). Medium-liquidity small coins are ideal.

3. Split orders: Large single orders can move the market; splitting into multiple smaller orders reduces slippage.

4. Control risk: Use a private RPC to avoid sandwich attacks.

❌ Crossfire Burns🔥
Every Trade Fuels deOTC + Partner Tokens

We’re introducing a new feature with our updated contract that takes our tokenomics to the next level:

🔹 3% Buy Tax
🔹 10% Sell Tax - WITH A SPECIAL TWIST

From the 10% Sell Tax:
🔹1% will go to a Burn Mechanism 🔥
🔹This burn will buy and burn another token from a partner community.
🔹9% will go to marketing for long term growth

*Note - This will be reduced over time 

For the 1% burn, every time someone trades deOTC, not only does it strengthen $DOTC, it also supports and burns tokens of a partner project, creating cross community growth and collaboration.

Holders in other communities will see the deOTC as a constant buyer which will bring attention to the project.

The other 9% is going into marketing, future proofing the project for the long term, this is imperative for the sustainability of the platform. 

*Example - $MOG:
Imagine if our chosen burn partner is $MOG.
When someone sells $DOTC, a portion of that tax buys $MOG off the market.
That $MOG is then burned forever, reducing its supply.
This means $MOG holders benefit every time our token is traded. 

🔥 This creates a win-win: deOTC can grow stronger while bringing new partner communities to us, since their favorite tokens are burned with our activity.

🔥 We can change the token we burn. Every week we can vote to burn a new token. Over time this will incentivize communities to partner with us and actively teach users about the many benefits that the deOTC platform brings for their respective projects.

A rise in net exports causes the traded sector to expand, which raises productivity and real income in surplus economies. ...major deficit economies may prefer to correct their traded-sector underproduction by moving to financial autarky.

https://t.co/92sj4UOzVD

🚨Food expenditure vs consumer expenditure

USA $3,694.353 vs $54,370.335

China $998.872 vs $4,705.762

This means the average Chinese spend only 8.6% of the amount spent by the average American on consumer expenditure‼️

@jmhorp and the propagandists at @OurWorldInData want us to focus on their RATIO and forget about the DENOMINATOR because:

⚠️70% to 75% of typical U.S. wage-earner budgets are paid to the FIRE sector & to US govt

The major elements in U.S. family budgets are housing (with prices bid up on credit), debt service and health insurance – and wage withholding for financializing Social Security and Medicare. Industrial firms also have been financialized, using debt leverage to increase their return on equity. The effect is for interest to increase as a proportion of cash flow (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). 

Corporate raiders pay their high-interest bondholders, while financial managers also are using this ebitda for stock buy-backs to increase share prices (and hence the value of their stock options).

Shifting taxes off property onto employment and retail sales spurs the financialization of family and business budgets as tax cuts on property are capitalized into higher bank loans. Payments to government agencies for taxes and pre-saving for Social Security and Medicare absorb another 30% of family budgets.

These transfer payments to the FIRE sector and government agencies have transformed international cost structures, absorbing roughly 75% of U.S. family budgets. 

➡️ The average Amerikkkan consumer expenditure is a ginormous financialized scam. The larger the scam the smaller their share of food expenditure is.

According to above data, the average Chinese spend 27% of the amount spent by the average American on food. 

BUT: 

“This data is expressed in US dollars per person. It is not adjusted for inflation or for differences in living costs between countries.”

The China purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion factor is the amount of Chinese Yuan (CNY) needed to buy the same basket of goods and services as one US dollar in the United States. The World Bank provides data for the GDP PPP conversion factor, which shows values around 3.55 CNY per international dollar for 2024.  

➡️ This means the average Chinese spending $998.872 for food in yuan is roughly equivalent to an Amerikkkan spending $3545 for the same goods. This is not so different from the actual Amerikkkan food expenditure at $3,694.353

So if the food expenditure is the same, one should ask why is an Amerikkkan total spending ballooned up to $54,370.335? 🤪

By purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion, the average Chinese spends only around $16,702 🤡

Stop chasing someone else’s profits like a ghost.

Most traders fail because they mimic charts without knowing the “why” behind them. 

Blindly following signals or social media tips will drain your account faster than you think.

Here’s the tip: Learn their strategy, test it on a demo, then adapt it to your style. 

Your edge is yours — not theirs.

If you keep copying, you’re not trading. 

You’re gambling with someone else’s homework. Own your moves or stay broke.

🔹 @brevis_zk
Behind the scenes, Brevis is building the zk co-processor that unlocks a massive gap: verified data across chains and from the outside world, accessible directly to smart contracts. Real infra, already integrating, already proving its worth.

Each solves a specific pain, they start to look like the full DeFi toolkit I have always wanted:
✅ Plan smarter and refine risk with LAB
✅ Trade transparently with Recall
✅ Connect verified data and expand reach with Brevis

Stakeholders called for reforms including reduced tariffs, harmonised regulations, and private-sector-led export mechanisms. They also stressed the need for infrastructure, innovation, and predictable policies to drive long-term growth.

Instead of simply waiting for staking or farming rewards, investors can separate the principal from the yield and trade these flows on a secondary market. This creates room for advanced strategies such as locking in returns early, speculating on future rates, or hedging against market volatility. In practice, Pendle turns yield into a tradable asset, bringing more liquidity, flexibility, and opportunities for those looking to optimize gains in the crypto ecosystem.  #pendle #ulianov #renatoulianov",Agri

Most international imports like electronics, machinery, food, or oil-related equipment are priced and invoiced in USD or other hard currencies like EUR. Iraq, as an import-dependent economy  importing 80% of its consumer goods, must convert IQD to USD to pay foreign suppliers. 

The Governor of the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI), Ali Mohsen Al-Alaq, said that Iraq is currently witnessing the lowest inflation levels in its modern history

This makes USD-denominated imports...80% of Iraq's goods ... cheaper in real terms,  It also stabilizes the CBI's peg, curbing devaluation risks Iraq's inflation hitting historic lows around 0.8% in Q2 2025,  preserves the dinar's purchasing power against the USD-pegged exchange rate 1,310 IQD/USD.

Higher inflation , the purchasing power of its currency falls.
CBI uses oil revenues (Iraq's main export) to back USD reserves, subsidizing the rate to keep imports viable.
