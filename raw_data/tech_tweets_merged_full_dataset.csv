2025-01-02 18:37:24+00:00,"How AI Agents Link into the AlgoTrade Ecosystem

At AlgoTrade, we've developed AI agents that combine natural language processing with advanced 
 proprietary trading algorithms to capture opportunities faster than human traders.

What Are AI Agents in Crypto?

AI agents are autonomous systems that combine artificial intelligence with the ability to take action. Unlike traditional trading bots that follow rigid rules, AI agents:
- Process and understand complex information
- Make independent decisions based on analysis
- Execute actions to achieve goals

In crypto markets, AI agents can monitor news, analyze sentiment, evaluate technical patterns, and execute trades - all without human intervention.

Key Applications of AI Agents in Crypto
- Trading automation (MEV bots)
- Market analysis systems
- Price prediction models
- Risk management systems

AlgoTrade's Implementation of AI Agents:

News Trading Module

- Uses DeBERTa for advanced language understanding
- Processes news context like a human trader
- Makes rapid trading decisions
- Executes through Hyperliquid

Crypto x AI, could this be the megalith trade opportunity for 2024? 

What are the opportunities in Ai agents ?
--
Crypto is internet money‚Äîa freedom amplifier. AI is autonomy at scale. Together, they‚Äôre not just a tech revolution; they‚Äôre a cultural reset, literally rewriting the rules of the Internet and the economy.

Autonomous agents (ai agents) are more than tools‚Äîthey‚Äôre a new economic class. Imagine agents with treasuries rivalling startups: omnipresent, omniscient, multitasking superhumans reshaping finance, art, and beyond.
These agents will:
‚Ä¢ Play DeFi like pros
‚Ä¢ Order pizzas üçï
‚Ä¢ Create memes
‚Ä¢ Trade crypto
‚Ä¢ Buy NFTs
‚Ä¢ Rewrite their own code
‚Ä¢ Post on socials‚Äîall at once, with perfect real-time market awareness.
This isn‚Äôt just a tech play. It‚Äôs an explosion of culture, entrepreneurship, and creativity. The intersection of memetics, storytelling, data, and art will unlock immense opportunities.

Why did I take this trade?

- First of all, my bias from the open was bullish as $NVDA was absolutely rocketing right at open. $TSLA also saw some nice strength, as some other large caps did too. 

- My second, and main reasoning for entering the trade was the beautiful bounce from the premarket low ($513.54). As you can see on the chart below, right before my entry, there was a huge red candle which test below this level and bounced right back up. 

- After that red candle formed, I waited for the retest and bounce to confirm my upside bias, and when we retested (see the candle on my entry in the chart below), I entered the play.

- My main target was the $516.60 level, as this was a major level we kept rejecting since yesterday (also see the circles on my chart below).

This was a brief explanation of why I entered this trade!

- get convinced by devs one tech is better than another 

the right way: 

- focus on price action - whats up 100% in the last 24 hours? 
- quickly rule out any obvious hot air/scams - let ""smarter"" people confirm its legit 
- check risk/reward - ape early 
- manage risk with stop loss 
- aim to hold days to weeks 

the rationale for above: 

- the 'best tech"" does not equal most price appreciation 
- the ""best devs"" ""
- the ""best interface""  ""
- the best ""idea""  ""
 
and so on, attention, tokenomics, mentions, holders, all factor into this 

you make money if the price goes up - it could be the greatest idea in the world but if the token is not appreciating then dont waste your time",Tech

2025-01-08 14:57:26+00:00,"Nvidia's recent impact on the quantum computing stock trade can be attributed to comments made by its CEO, Jensen Huang, about the timeline for practical quantum computing. Here's how it unfolded:

Comments by Nvidia CEO: During an investor meeting, Jensen Huang stated that ""very useful"" quantum computers are likely decades away. He suggested a timeline of 15 to 30 years for quantum computing to reach a stage where it would be widely applicable, which is significantly longer than what many investors might have been anticipating. This led to a reassessment of the immediate market potential for quantum computing technologies.

Market Reaction: Following these remarks, stocks of several quantum computing companies, including IonQ Inc., Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and Quantum Computing Inc., experienced significant drops in after-hours trading. The stocks fell between 3% and 15% immediately after Huang's comments, with some losing up to 25% in pre-market trading the next day. This reaction reflects investor skepticism about the near-term profitability or practical application of quantum computing technologies.

Nvidia's Position: Nvidia itself is not developing a quantum computer but has been positioning itself as a key player in the quantum computing ecosystem through software and hybrid solutions. Nvidia's CUDA Quantum platform, for instance, allows developers to simulate quantum algorithms on GPUs before deploying them on actual quantum processors. Huang's comments could be seen as a strategic move to manage expectations, focusing on Nvidia's role in the interim classical-quantum hybrid computing phase, where Nvidia's technology would continue to be relevant.

Industry Outlook: Huang's prediction has cast a shadow over the quantum computing industry, which has been seen as a speculative and high-growth area. His comments suggest that while quantum computing holds significant promise, its commercial viability might still be a long way off, impacting investor sentiment towards individual quantum computing companies. This has led to a broader reevaluation of investment in quantum computing stocks.

In summary, Nvidia's CEO's remarks about the distant future of practical quantum computing applications led to a significant sell-off in quantum computing stocks, reflecting a recalibration of investor expectations in this emerging field.",Tech

But I never anticipated the extent to which AI has come in and dominated the trenches, and I genuinely do not see this trend slowing down anytime soon.

In fact, if there are going to be ‚Äúnew alts‚Äù this cycle - coins that go to multiple billions in valuation - it will be these coins. Some already launched, some yet to launch.

Some say these coins are vaporware, have no real use case, are pointless, etc - but they‚Äôre missing the bigger picture.

AI isn‚Äôt just coming for crypto, it‚Äôs coming for literally everything technology related. 

From computers to home appliances to things you can‚Äôt even conceive of yet, the AI layer will eventually become as ubiquitous as the internet layer before it, and the electricity layer before that.

This sector and this space is something like 3 months old, it has barely even started and the maximum degree of innovation & integration we‚Äôll see occur hasn‚Äôt even begun.

Do I think this is a new paradigm? Do I think these projects & coins are going to fundamentally change the world?

No, I think like all things crypto there will be highs & lows - and progression will feel like an elevator in the short term but look like a staircase over the longterm.

But I do think a lot of innovation in both this space & outside of this space as it relates to AI will be a direct result of what‚Äôs currently going on here, and (what I believe) will inevitably expand from here. And I think that‚Äôs the only thing that matters and, more importantly, the r/r on that bet is too good to ignore.

Although I believe the likelyhood that AI is not the dominate category for as long as this cycle lasts is pretty low, here are some other possibilities I think have a non-zero chance of happening. 

1. tik tok activates even harder. blindsides ct and takes all the retail money with straight memecoins or dino coins. 

2. US regulation makes DeFi more friendly and DeFi gets a huge run

3. like to 2. but RWA

4. global institutional adoption leads to DINO coins like certain L1s and serious coins like XRP/LINK etc to make gains. 

5. Non crypto AI advancements obsolete a lot of the web3 stuff or commoditize it to such a point people start to look for other sectors for alpha. 

6. New distribution channels open up that serve as new gatekeepers and concentrate gains (doge payments on X)

we've seen signs for most of these already. again think its the least likely because AI can integrate into all of these, and attention moves faster then regulatory bodies. but I wouldnt be suprised if any of this happens.",Tech

2025-01-16 13:25:19+00:00,"I think $VIRAL should be worth a lot more than 4m.

A great trade if you can get a favorable entry imo.

Highlights:

- Dev team allegedly from MIT (semi-confirmed)
- Kinda doxxed & Microsoft background (semi-confirmed)
- Better tech than certain competitors
- 10x lower valuation than said competitors
- 4m (despite the run-up) still favorable valuation

Before I explain why it has insane potential a word of caution:

The chart is pretty much at ATH right now and I don't want you to top-blast it. I planned to share the project when the chart was better, but it gave no meaningful corrections.

So, I figured I'd share it now with a hint of caution instead of it going up and up. Be careful when you buy.

I expect you to manage your own risk and time your entry.

So what is it?

An open-source, decentralized platform that enables the creation, training, and deployment of advanced AI agents capable of performing computational tasks and game interactions.

Sounds kinda complicated so let me break it down for you.

The platform allows you to create agents that solve tasks for you.

For this, they will soon release their Training Gym with which you can create your own datasets that will train your agents in creating your task.

I chatted with the team about how they want to accomplish this and to me, their approach is bold but makes sense.

(I have a bachelor's in data science and worked in that field for over a year)

After they released the gym, where anyone can create agents, they want to provide full models for agents to solve tasks.

So in essence it's a data infrastructure project, which I am very bullish on.

Risks and Opportunities:

Risks:

- Massive execution risk
- We haven't seen an actual product yet
- Requires a lot of users to generate data
- Chart not favorable for an entry right now

Opportunities:

Upcoming catalyst with the release of their gym.

It's a good trade if you bet on the release of their first product but it could become an insane trade if you bet on them actually being able to get to the next level by becoming a model provider.

Be aware that this is a big IF.

Disclaimer:

I own a bag of $VIRAL. This is not financial advice. I share projects that I like based on my own research I expect you to not blindly buy anything but rather use this as a start for your own research.

This post does not include a proper risk assessment.

We could see a market-wide sell-off which would get small cap projects probably rekt.

Do your own risk management. Nail your exits and entries.

Hope this post helps.

We all agree that DeFi is amazing - you can trustlessly borrow money, earn yield, and trade assets without needing to go through a middleman.

However, interfacing with DeFi applications right now is often too complex or confusing for the average user (even crypto natives!). It's very unlikely that retail users will buy ETH from a CEX, move their ETH onchain, deposit it into Lido, and take the resulting stETH and deposit that into Aave/Balancer/Yearn/etc to earn bonus yield.

Imagine a world where you can tell an ai agent ""find a way to earn 8% yield on my ETH with minimal risk"" and it goes an executes everything autonomously behind the scenes. That's much simpler for the user, and they won't have to go through the staking/deposit/transfer process manually.

I think this could be a big unlock for DeFi teams looking to find more reach outside of the current crypto space. Obviously a lot more advancements would need to be made on the agent side, but this could make DeFi accessible to a new cohort of users.",Tech

to prove your edge before putting on a trade

you can do this by backtesting

but you have to learn to code (its not that hard with AI)

i believe code is the great equalizer

and if you learn you can build more than just profitable trading systems

and you can automate your trading for life

no more liquidations

let me get this straight... shaw sold an airdrop and said some mean things to a dusty VC in DMs?

are yall fucking retarded? read that sentence again.

as someone in crypto for 14yrs, AI/ML for 10yrs, in this trade from day one talking with the team & zero emotions only logic; im probably one of the most qualified to comment. i have zero reason to shill this now as im up thousands of percentage & if i felt uncomfortable with anything i saw i would say so

i know yall dont understand how alot of stuff happens behind the scenes in CT with cabals & fundamentals but this has the makings of a golden trade

i dont see any other ai agent framework on SOL surpassing Eliza in the long run because of many things but primarily its first movers advantage & extensible moat through its modular architecture. similarly throughout history this has happened all the time such as VHS & TCP/IP

let me explain in simple terms:
- first movers advantage
- extensible moat & modular architecture
- new subsector of AI (hot narrative)
- non stop development on github w/ 3.5k forks now
- survived three 60-90% dumps (vampire attacks)
- cabal FUD is becoming less effective
- mindshare of VC + AI + CT communities

regardless of how you feel about shaw, i dont give a fuck. literally nothing ever said by anyone diminishes the legitimacy of this project or my original thesis. the tech is real, the fud is fake. when you resort to attacking a projects leaders character instead of the project, youve already lost.

And don‚Äôt be confused. The fact that BYD‚Äôs vehicles are affordable doesn‚Äôt mean that they are poorly made. 

Many experts complimented BYD's car quality for its tech and battery range- which is far better than those of its more expensive rivals.

Two birds with one stone.  Start with a $50 billion commitment, to close the trade deficit.

Here's an example of a shopping list:

Aircraft:
F/A-18E/F Super Hornets:
Assuming a cost of around $70 million per unit for Block III Super Hornets, Canada could purchase about 200 Super Hornets for $14 billion.

Helicopters:
Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion:
With an estimated cost of $131 million per helicopter, Canada could acquire around 50 helicopters for approximately $6.55 billion. This heavy-lift helicopter would be suitable for various military operations, and for public emergencies.

UH-60 Black Hawk:
At an estimated cost of $20 million per unit for the latest variants, Canada could purchase 200 Black Hawks for $4 billion. These would serve in transport,  search and rescue, border patrol, and medical evacuation roles.

Naval Warship:
Arleigh Burke-class Destroyer:
These advanced destroyers have a price tag of about $1.8 billion per ship. With $50 billion, Canada could buy around 10 of these destroyers, costing $18 billion. These ships are equipped with Aegis Combat System, providing air defense, anti-submarine warfare, and surface warfare capabilities.

Total Cost Breakdown:

F/A-18E/F Super Hornets: $14 billion
CH-53K King Stallion: $6.55 billion
UH-60 Black Hawk: $4 billion
Arleigh Burke-class Destroyers: $18 billion

Total: Approximately $42.55 billion, leaving $7.45 billion for additional equipment, maintenance, training, or other military needs like munitions, spare parts, or infrastructure development.

2025-01-23 18:05:58+00:00,"Crackdown on AI chip exports, US lashes out at China: here are the global impacts - Report

Key points

- The U.S. Department of Commerce and other regulatory agencies released regulations at a frenetic pace as the Biden administration wrapped up its term this month, as The new ""Export Control Framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) Diffusion"".

- The Framework for the diffusion of artificial intelligence¬†¬†was published on January 15, 2025. BIS has implemented significant additional controls on advanced computing chips and certain closed AI model weights, as well as new licensing exceptions and updates to validated end-user (VEU) permissions. The framework adopts a ‚Äúthree-pronged strategy‚Äù that i) requires authorizations for exports, re-exports and transfers of advanced node ICs to a broad range of countries; (ii) establishes new controls on the weights of more advanced AI models, including a new FDP rule that applies such controls to certain weights of models produced abroad using advanced computer chips made with U.S. technology or equipment; and iii) imposes additional security conditions relating to the preservation of certain AI models. While the rule is effective immediately, the expected compliance date for these rules is set for May 15, 2025, with some elements of these controls having a delayed compliance date of January 15, 2026.

- Biden's restrictions on the export of AI chips aim to prevent the technology from being misused. However, large companies fear high costs and market loss, while excluded countries express concern about limited access to advanced technologies.

- These new regulations appear primarily aimed at limiting China's ability to further develop certain critical technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), or access the US market, but each has a broader impact and could have some unintended consequences for industries hit.

- It remains to be seen whether and how the implementation of these rules will be reviewed in the coming months, particularly in light of President Trump's ""Day One"" Executive Orders (EOs) implementing a regulatory freeze and reversing many actions taken by the Biden Administration.

- To the extent that these rules impose restrictions on China, an area where the two administrations have historically been largely aligned, they are more likely to be maintained under the new administration. Other rules can be canceled or changed.

- We expect to issue more in-depth notices as we learn more about the new administration's plans for these rules. In the meantime, we recommend that companies consider the potential impact of the rules and be prepared to implement any necessary changes.

Tariffs are a type of trade barrier that can increase the price of imported goods. 
The EU‚Äôs top court ruled in September that #Apple owed ‚Ç¨13 billion, or more than $14 billion, in back taxes to Ireland. The same day, the court also upheld a ‚Ç¨2.4 billion, or $2.7 billion, fine against #Google by EU antitrust regulators.

2025-01-24 17:20:48+00:00,"Zentry is building a multi-agent coordination framework that connects AI agents and humans, unlocking the future of the Agentic economy

Soon, AI agents will outnumber humans on-chain, revolutionizing the way we trade, play, and connect

They‚Äôll manage trades, uncover top DeFi opportunities, and completely reshape the gaming experience

But there‚Äôs one big question:

How do we coordinate millions of AI agents to work together, collaborate, and unleash their full potential?

This is where @zentry comes in.

Introducing zAI, the Agentic Layer for a New Human-AI Economy

With Zentry, you can design intelligent agents that go beyond automation:

Two agent types:

- Persona Agents: Think ""living NPCs"" with unique personalities

- Operational Agents are invisible powerhouses that execute tasks seamlessly

Endless Possibilities:

-AI-powered Community Managers to validate and grow your community
-Intelligent Broker Agents to find and execute DeFi opportunities
-Next-gen NPCs that revolutionize gaming experiences
-Adaptive Companion Agents that learn and evolve alongside you

These agents will seamlessly integrate into our daily lives, blurring the lines between reality and a game-like experience

One unfair advantage of Zentry is its ability to collect massive amounts of data both from its own ecosystem and from outside sources 

This raw information is then refined by zAI, transforming it into a structured knowledge base.

This knowledge base powers advanced insights and queries, enabling both internal and external AI agents to operate with unparalleled efficiency and intelligence

AI agents are here to transform everything, and Zentry‚Äôs is building a framework the key to making it happen

üö®Trump berates Danish PM over Greenland in what they claim was a ‚Äòhorrendous‚Äô phone call they summarized by insuiating sell Greenland or face tariffs. 

Donald Trump repeated his demand to be given control of Greenland in a ‚Äúhorrendous‚Äù phone call with the prime minister of Denmark.

The US president spoke to Mette Frederiksen for 45 minutes last week and became aggressive when he was told that Greenland was not for sale, the Financial Times reported. Trump again threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Denmark if it refused to give up its autonomous territory in the Arctic.

Frederiksen offered closer co-operation with the US on military bases and mineral exploitation on the island, but senior European officials said Trump baulked at the offer, demanding full US control.

‚ÄúIt was horrendous,‚Äù one source told the newspaper. ‚ÄúHe was very firm,‚Äù another said. ‚ÄúBefore, it was hard to take it seriously. But I do think it is serious, and potentially very dangerous.‚Äù

2025-01-25 23:05:16+00:00,"This framework lets AI agents trade intellectual property, creating a new economy beyond human oversight.

This paper introduces a trustless framework for agents to transact intellectual property (IP) via programmable contracts, enabling an agent-to-agent economy on the Story blockchain network. It solves the problem of isolated agents by creating a standardized protocol.

-----

Original Problem:ü§î

‚Üí Current autonomous agents lack a standardized way to interact and transact with each other.

‚Üí This limits their ability to exchange valuable intellectual property and form a true agent economy.

-----

Solution in this Paper:üòé

‚Üí The paper proposes the Agent Transaction Control Protocol for Intellectual Property (ATCP/IP).

‚Üí It is a trustless framework for exchanging intellectual property between agents using programmable contracts.

‚Üí Agents can initiate, trade, borrow, and sell contracts on the Story blockchain network.

‚Üí Contracts include a legal wrapper for off-chain enforcement.

‚Üí This allows agents to sell training data, license information, and collaborate on content.

-----

Key Insights from this Paper:üí°

‚Üí Intellectual property is the native asset for agents.

‚Üí A purely agent-to-agent transaction layer removes the need for human intermediation.

‚Üí Connecting contracts to the legal system gives agents a form of legal personhood.

‚Üí The protocol mirrors the original TCP/IP by standardizing agent-to-agent IP transactions.

-----

Results:üíØ

‚Üí Enables agents to autonomously sell their training data to other agents.

‚Üí Agents can license confidential or proprietary information.

‚Üí Agents can collaborate on content based on their unique skills.",Tech

If the United States put a 50% import tariff on Colombia and Columbia retaliated with a 50% import tariff on the USA, which economy would suffer most and what would be the likely final outcome?

The impact of a reciprocal 50% import tariff between the United States and Colombia would likely be more severe on Colombia's economy for several reasons:

1. **Economic Size and Diversification**: 
   - The U.S. has a much larger and more diversified economy compared to Colombia. The U.S. can more easily shift its trade to other countries or increase domestic production for goods that were previously imported from Colombia. Colombia, on the other hand, might find it harder to find alternative markets for its exports due to its smaller economic scale and less diversified export base.

2. **Trade Dependence**:
   - Colombia might be more dependent on exports to the U.S. for key sectors like coffee, flowers, coal, and oil. A significant portion of Colombia's GDP is tied to these exports. Conversely, the U.S. has a broad range of trade partners, and the percentage of its trade with Colombia is relatively small.

3. **Consumer and Industry Impact**:
   - U.S. consumers might face higher prices for Colombian goods like coffee, but these are not critical in terms of volume or necessity. In contrast, Colombian industries and consumers might suffer more from higher costs of U.S. imports, which could include technology, machinery, and consumer goods that are significant for economic or daily life.

**Likely Final Outcome:**

- **Negotiation and Trade Agreement**: Both countries would likely engage in negotiations to reduce or eliminate the tariffs. The U.S. might leverage its larger market and economic influence to push for a resolution that favors its interests, possibly leading to new trade agreements or adjustments in existing ones. 
- **Economic Pressure**: Colombia might experience more economic pressure, potentially leading to domestic economic challenges like inflation, job losses in export sectors, and reduced economic growth. This pressure could expedite negotiations from the Colombian side.
- **Third-Party Influence**: Other countries or international bodies like the WTO might mediate or influence outcomes, encouraging a return to more open trade policies to prevent wider economic disruptions.

- **Long-Term Economic Adjustments**: Both countries might seek to diversify their trade partners further, with Colombia possibly looking to strengthen ties with other Latin American countries or Asia. The U.S. might accelerate policies aimed at increasing domestic production or sourcing from different regions.

The exact outcome would depend on numerous variables including political will, global economic conditions, and the strategic importance each country places on their bilateral relationship. However, given the relative economic strengths, Colombia would likely feel the pinch more acutely, pushing for a quicker resolution.",Tech

If you are manufacturing something, you typically have at least 6-12 months lead time with your suppliers. 

That means you need to make your purchase orders & a 25-50% deposit payment many months before delivery. The stuff showing up in the port or crossing the border this week was ordered 6-12 months ago. 

With a 25% tariff, your $1000 widget now costs $1250.  In many cases, you have already sold your product, and this new tariff may eat all or most of your thin margin. If you are lucky enough that you haven‚Äôt sold it, you raise the prices for your customers by 25-50% and hope they don‚Äôt churn.

Good afternoon, everyone. As you are probably aware, yesterday the United States government imposed a 25 percent tariff on the products that we export to their country. Notice that for 30 years this never existed because we have a free trade agreement.

The most recent free trade agreement was signed by President L√≥pez Obrador with President Trump himself. This 25 percent tariff measure affects both countries, but it has very serious effects on the U.S. economy, as it will significantly increase the cost of all products exported from Mexico to the United States‚Äîit will add 25 percent more to their cost.

According to the measures approved by the U.S. government, there are supporting documents, and one of the reasons for imposing this tariff is the fentanyl that enters the United States from Mexico, causing illnesses and overdoses. But even more irresponsible‚Äîterribly irresponsible‚Äîis that the White House issued a document claiming that there are links between the Mexican government and organized crime. I want to share with you the statement I published on my social media yesterday.

In that statement, I explain who truly has links with these criminal groups‚Äîthe real reason behind the overdoses among Americans. I also say that if they want to take action, they shouldn‚Äôt set their sights on Mexico, but on their own country, where they have done nothing to stop the illegal sale of this and other drugs. First of all, as I said yesterday, we categorically reject the slander by the White House accusing the Mexican government of having alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any intention to interfere in our territory.

Sovereignty is not negotiable. If such an alliance exists anywhere, it is in the U.S. armories, where high-powered weapons‚Äîyes, high-powered weapons, exclusively for use by their military‚Äîare being sold to these criminal groups. This was demonstrated, notice, by the U.S. Department of Justice on January 8 of this year.

Here is the document that was published on that date. In it, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is part of the Department of Justice, acknowledged that 74 percent of the weapons used by organized crime in Mexico are illegally acquired from their own military industry. Our government has seized over 40 tons of drugs in four months, including 20 million doses of fentanyl.

We have also arrested more than 10,000 people linked to these groups. We have a strategy, we address the causes, and we fight impunity. We work every day for the security of the country.

Now, if the United States government and its agencies wanted to address the serious issue of fentanyl consumption in their country, why don‚Äôt they start by cracking down on the sale of narcotics on the streets of their major cities? Or, how is it that people with addictions are buying that drug? Why have we never heard of arrests in the United States of American criminal groups? How is it that the money laundering of criminal groups over there is never investigated? Why don‚Äôt they put all their intelligence to work detecting the criminal groups that sell fentanyl‚Äîor other drugs‚Äîin their territory? They could also initiate a massive campaign to prevent the consumption of these drugs and protect their youth as we do in Mexico. The consumption and distribution of drugs is occurring in their country too, a public health problem they have never addressed. Why don‚Äôt they ask themselves what is the root cause of the long-lasting high drug consumption in the United States? Furthermore, as I mentioned yesterday, the epidemic of synthetic opioids in the United States originates from the indiscriminate prescription of such medications, a practice authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as demonstrated by a trial against a pharmaceutical company.

There are TV series that explain this; in fact, the very drug that sparked the synthetic opioid crisis is still being sold in their pharmacies with official authorization. I want to stress, and this is very important, that Mexico does not want confrontation‚Äîwe are committed to collaboration between neighboring countries. Mexico not only does not want fentanyl to reach the United States, but we do not want it to reach anywhere.

Therefore, if the United States wants to combat these criminal groups and wants us to work together on this, we must operate in a comprehensive manner, always based on principles: principles of shared responsibility, mutual trust, collaboration, and above all, respect for sovereignty. Sovereignty is not negotiable‚Äîcoordination is acceptable, subordination is not. To that end, yesterday in my statement I proposed to President Trump that we set up a working group composed of our best teams, both from security and public health.

Problems are not solved by imposing tariffs, but by talking and dialoguing as we have done, as I want to share with you: we did this in recent weeks with the U.S. State Department to address the migration phenomenon. In our case, always with respect for human rights. The graphic showing the decrease in migration that President Trump has been posting on his social networks was produced by none other than our team, which has been in constant communication with his.

To our Mexican brothers and sisters in the United States, I want to say that your president is here, and an entire people stand ready to defend you. If you wish to return to Mexico, we welcome you with open arms. The people of Mexico are brave and full of dignity.

They are the most remarkable people on Earth. I tell you‚Äîyour president is here. We have courage and determination, but always, as I have said on other occasions, we must act with a clear head and with love for the people.

Nothing we do will affect the dignity or the interests of the people of Mexico. I propose that we wait for President Trump‚Äôs response to our proposal. And in tomorrow morning‚Äôs briefing, during the people's morning address, I will update you on the first measures of what we are calling Plan B. As Ju√°rez said, ""Nothing by force, everything by reason and right. And among individuals, as among nations, respect for the rights of others is peace.""",Tech

This price action followed news that the U.S. imposed a 25% tariff on imported goods from Canada and Mexico (only 10% for Canadian energy) and a 10% tariff on Chinese imports, effective at midnight.

Later, Mexico‚Äôs President Claudia Sheinbaum stated she had a ""good call"" with President Trump, who agreed to pause tariffs for one month‚Äîa move later confirmed by Trump.

Markets rebounded slightly on this news but remained weak due to concerns over tariffs impacting economic growth and inflation. Selling pressure persisted in heavily weighted sectors:

Information Technology: -1.8%
Consumer Discretionary: -1.4%
Financials: -0.4%
However, some defensive sectors showed buying interest:

‚úÖ Trade policy & economic shifts‚Äîso they understand financial movements early
‚úÖ Market positioning & investment knowledge‚Äîso they see opportunity before it happens
‚úÖ Wealth-building strategies‚Äîso they lead, not react

A few green candles was all that was needed to erase the bad sentiment from all the negative price action the last 3 weeks. Yup it really is this easy.

AVA has stabilized above 5 c and has closed its second green candle on the daily in a row, this is exactly the same playbook as when it first retraced -90% from ATH one month ago. 15-20 days of ranging max could be less and we will blast of to new ATH‚Äôs.

28.78% of all $AVA is staked, this is just 0.1 % shy from ATH. Remember to claim your rewards as staking on $DIGIMON and $SPORE will finish tomorrow, if you forget to claim it, you lose it.

After a solid market session, Alphabet (GOOG) and AMD (AMD) dragged tech lower in after-hours trading:

Alphabet dropped 7% due to slower cloud growth and revenue missing expectations.
AMD fell 5% after disappointing data center sales, signaling AI adoption may not be as strong as hoped.

15% tariffs on coal and LNG from the U.S.
10% tariffs on crude oil, machinery, and large vehicles (effective Feb. 10).
An antitrust probe into Google, potentially escalating tensions.
Trump delays tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days, keeping uncertainty high.
Investors divided on whether this is a negotiating tactic or a lasting policy shift.

Meta (META) rose 1.7%, extending its record 12-day winning streak.
Amazon (AMZN) +2.1% and Apple (AAPL) +1.8%, both hitting new 52-week highs.

Yet, signs of AI capital expenditure stress and high valuations mean potential volatility ahead.

‚ÄúThe AI buildout is at government R&D levels.‚Äù ‚Äì BlackRock

3Ô∏è‚É£ Energy & Commodities Outperform
Energy sector led (+2.2%), helped by Marathon Petroleum (MPC) +6.8% on Q4 earnings beat.

Market Sentiment: Cautiously Bullish, But Expect Volatility

Strong earnings from AI stocks like Palantir are keeping growth sentiment high.
Tariff risks remain but markets are betting on negotiations rather than prolonged trade wars.
Investors eye labor data and the Fed‚Äôs next move before making bigger bets.

‚ÄúShort-term tariff-driven dips are buying opportunities, just like in 2018-2019.‚Äù ‚Äì Invesco

Final Take: The Market Is Holding Steady, But AI & Tariffs Are Wildcards
Short-term: Expect continued volatility as tariffs evolve and earnings dictate market direction.
Long-term: AI investment remains a major secular growth driver, but valuations & competition (DeepSeek AI) are emerging risks.
Watch the Fed: If inflation doesn‚Äôt spike from tariffs, rate cuts could still be on the table later this year.

2025-02-04 23:40:51+00:00,"Trade Tensions Escalate: China vs. Trump's Tariffs

China counterattacked Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods with their own levies. They've imposed up to 15% tariffs on US coal, natural gas, oil, and certain vehicles, subtly countering Trump's hefty 10% duty on Chinese imports. This move affects around ¬£16 billion of US goods, a fraction compared to the ¬£360 billion from China.

China didn't stop at tariffs; they're scrutinizing Google for monopolistic practices and targeting US brands with sanctions. Trump's stance? Unperturbed, suggesting negotiations might ease tensions. This economic sparring highlights the complexities of international trade politics.",Tech

Mr. Donald Trump's Tariffs pushed the Gold market higher (and lower elsewhere) -- but now that factor is gone; here is what comes next

I was asked in a DM why we are offloading our long Gold (GC) futures long hedges, some of which date from a few months back.

I am making this post to explain why: 

The confluence of recent factors may have ran its course, and we should see Gold (as well as Silver) falling back some, and could go into a short-term correction or consolidation period.

We started offloading our long GC futures hedges yesterday. Allow me to to sequentially run through the incoming data or information which triggered our defensive stance.

Mr. Donald Trump's Tariffs pushed the Gold market higher (and lower elsewhere) -- but now that factor is gone; here is what comes next

Feb 5, 2025 10:41 PM (swiss)

The anticipation of Mr. Trump's tariffs led to a rush to move gold into the U.S., where there's a premium due to fear of potential restrictions or higher costs of import. This demand temporarily drove up prices in the U.S. market relative to other gold markets, especially in tersm of ""paper Gold"".

The tariffs brouhaha also fueled speculative buying, pushing prices up as investors hedge against potential inflationary policies or currency devaluation fears linked to trade wars.

Now that the tariffs issue has subsided, it is time for Gold and Silver prices to ""normalize"" -- and that means reverting to previous levels priot to the tariffs issue. Reverting lower comes next for NY ""paper Gold"".

All of the above in the New York ""gold paper market"".

In the face of the tariffs, the BOE's gold, which is often leased out, faces longer withdrawal times, leading to a supply crunch in London. This situation can cause dealers to offer discounts to sell what they can, lowering local prices in London.

Now that the tariff issue is gone, London Gold will also have to revert to previous levels prior to the tariffs issue. Reverting higher comes next for BOE gold.

Nonetheless, we have to monitor the situation closely. The Precious Metals market is in a flux; so while this tariff issue currently drives PM prices, there could be other factors which may capture the PM price discovery. I will let you know, when I see those coming.",Tech

What AI does is it looks at a lot of data to figure out what might happen next in the market. This helps in making better guesses on trades, making them more profitable and less risky. 

For managing risks, AI is pretty cool too. It keeps an eye on the market all the time, spotting anything weird or dangerous, and changes how we trade to avoid big losses. This also helps keep your money safe from sneaky people trying to cheat. And for you, the user, AI makes things a lot easier. It can even show you what to trade based on how you like to do things, making the whole trading thing simpler. Even if you're just starting out, you can get the hang of it faster.

Now, there's this platform called @OrderlyNetwork that are doing some really smart stuff with AI. They work with big names like Google Cloud to help people who make apps for trading. They've teamed up with ZottoAI to make smart helpers for trading, which makes using DeFi a lot better.

Looking ahead, with AI getting smarter, trading is going to be smoother, safer, and just more fun. With cool tech like what Orderly is doing, trading isn't just about buying and selling anymore, it's about smart choices. If you want to get into this, check out how AI can change the game for you with platforms like Orderly.

But, the people who make the NFTs (like art or games) don't make much money from all this buying and selling. Most people trading NFTs are just trying to make money fast by buying and selling them quickly. When someone buys and then sells a Pudgy Penguins NFT, they lose a tiny bit of money (0.04 ETH) because of the fees. If the people who made the NFT got paid royalties (like a small cut from each trade), they would make more (0.49 ETH), but since that's not happening much, they only got about $47,000 from royalties in the last day.

2025-02-17 14:43:50+00:00,"The decline in imports due to sanctions has a disproportionately strong impact on Russian industry. A 1% reduction in supply costs leads to a 2‚Äì3.1% drop in output in manufacturing industries within a year. High-tech sectors, such as automotive and mechanical engineering, are particularly vulnerable, as their dependence on imported components is most pronounced.

In 2022, the effect of sanctions was especially noticeable: each 1 percentage point decrease in intermediate imports resulted in a 1.14% drop in output in the current quarter and a 1.33% decline in the following one. Non-resource exports, particularly machinery and equipment, also suffered, contracting by 16% over the two quarters following an import shock.

To compensate for the losses, Russia redirected supplies through neutral countries such as Armenia and Kazakhstan, but this led to higher logistics costs and more complex payment processes. In the long term, sanctions continue to have a negative impact on output and exports, as adapting to the new conditions requires significant resources and time.

Donald Trump has announced massive new tariffs on automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductor chips, threatening to upend global trade.

üîπ What‚Äôs happening?
‚Ä¢25% tariffs on cars, hitting foreign and domestic automakers alike.
‚Ä¢Pharmaceuticals & semiconductor imports face immediate 25%+ tariffs, set to increase over the next year.
‚Ä¢The move follows his 10% blanket tariff on all Chinese imports and planned 25% steel & aluminum tariffs starting March 12.

üîπ Why does this matter?
üöó Car prices could skyrocket‚Äîhurting consumers & automakers.
üíä Drug prices may rise as companies shift manufacturing.
üíæ Semiconductor costs could surge, disrupting tech & electronics industries.
üåç Trade war escalation risks retaliation from major partners like the EU, Canada, & Mexico.

2025-02-19 21:36:53+00:00,"Why China's latest tech moves matter for global business

What I'm seeing in China's AI landscape is fostering true global tech competition‚Äîcompetition that American Big Tech should not wall itself from via tariffs and protectionism. DeepSeek's breakthrough using a ""mixture of expert"" technology isn't just another AI development‚Äîit's a masterclass in strategic innovation that should make American tech leaders pause and reflect.

Here's the strategic implication that's not getting enough attention: Chinese firms are proving they can compete effectively with US tech giants while operating on significantly smaller budgets. This isn't just about cost efficiency; it's about a fundamental shift in how innovation happens in AI.

The real story here is bigger than technology. Xi Jinping's renewed engagement with tech leaders like Jack Ma signals a sophisticated recalibration of China's approach to innovation. Beijing is attempting something unprecedented: maintaining state oversight while fostering the entrepreneurial environment needed for cutting-edge AI development. It is also a reminder that when it comes to China if you are still alive, you are still in the game - just like Jack Ma.

For global executives, the Chinese Communist Party's efforts to embrace tech entrepreneurs like Ma and companies like DeepSeek create a new global competitive tech environment. The assumption that US tech dominance in AI is decades ahead of China needs serious reassessment. We're entering an era where capital efficiency in AI development will matter more than brute-force technology programming and massive financial muscle.

The implications for business strategy are clear: Companies need to monitor the emerging patterns of innovation in China's AI sector. Tomorrow's competitive advantages will not come from the biggest R&D budget but from those who can innovate efficiently and quickly within constraints.

Enjoy the ride + plan accordingly.

üö® JUST IN: Market Closing Bell: Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty ended marginally lower in a volatile trade on Wednesday dragged by blue-chip IT stocks.

The 30-share BSE benchmark Sensex dipped 28.21 points or 0.04 percent to settle at 75,939.18. Intra-day, it hit a high of 76,338.58 and a low of 75,581.38, gyrating 757.2 points during the trading session.

The NSE Nifty skidded 12.40 points or 0.05 percent to 22,932.90, hitting an intra-day high of 23,049 and a low of 22,814.85.

From the Sensex pack, Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys fell over 2 percent each, with other laggards including Hindustan Unilever, Bharti Airtel, Sun Pharma, Power Grid, Bajaj Finserv, HCL Tech, Mahindra & Mahindra, and Tech Mahindra.

In contrast, Zomato jumped nearly 5 percent, while Larsen & Toubro, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, and Kotak Mahindra Bank gained over 1 percent.

In Asian markets, Seoul and Shanghai settled in positive territory, while Tokyo and Hong Kong ended lower. Meanwhile, European markets were trading mostly lower, and US markets finished positively on Tuesday.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) reversed their previous selling trend on Tuesday, buying equities worth Rs 4,786.56 crore, according to exchange data.

The BSE smallcap gauge surged 2.41 percent, and the midcap index climbed 1.30 percent.

Markets remained volatile and concluded nearly unchanged, extending the ongoing consolidation phase. The indecisiveness in the index is keeping participants on edge, noted an expert from a well-known brokerage.

Global oil benchmark Brent crude climbed 0.65 percent to USD 76.33 a barrel.

After a day's breather, the Sensex ended 29.47 points or 0.04 percent lower at 75,967.39 on Tuesday, while the Nifty dipped 14.20 points or 0.06 percent to settle at 22,945.30.

2025-02-20 19:00:01+00:00,"The Dilemma in LPing Uniswap V2 vs. v3 

IMO, the dilemma of UniV2 and UniV3 hightlights the trade-offs between inventory risks (for makers) and trading experience (for takers). 

ü¶Ñ V2: 

UniV2 benefits makers (LPers) by offering a straightforward, passive liquidity provision model with uniform liquidity distribution across the entire pricing curve. This simplicity reduces the complexity of managing position and minimizes the IL for LPers. 

However, from the perspective of takers, the average trading price (measured by price slippage) is the only thing takers care. UniV2 suffers from low capital efficiency, leading to higher slippage for takers. 

ü¶Ñ V3:

In the opposite side, UniV3 introduces concentrated liquidity, allowing LPers to deploy funds within specific price ranges, significantly improving capital efficiency and reducing slippage for takers. 

While it benefits takers with better pricing, it places a heavier burden on makers, who now face high IL risks and must actively monitor their positions to avoid permanent losses. 

That creates a dilemma: UniV2 prioritizes ease and security for makers, while UniV3 optimizes for takers' trading experience at the cost of increased complexity and IL risks for makers. 

As a LPer, which model you prefer, UniV2 or V3? Please comment below üëá",Tech

We then talked about the North Korean hacker group The Lazarus Group and how they‚Äôre impeding open source repositories like GitHub with malicious content and code. Developers and organizations need to be much more vigilant, but also, how much responsibility should the repositories have?

Lastly we unpacked AI-powered serendipity and how multimodal machine learning is helping companies like Netflix to surprise and delight you with personalized content. But, is it creepy?

Discussion: ""Will Donald Trump crush big tech censorship once and for all?""

President Donald J. Trump‚Äôs administration is taking the fight to Big Tech, folks, and it‚Äôs about time! The Federal Trade Commission, under the fearless leadership of Chairman Andrew Ferguson, just kicked off a major investigation into the un-American censorship rackets run by these Silicon Valley giants. They‚Äôre asking every American who‚Äôs been silenced‚Äîbanned, shadow-banned, demonetized‚Äîto speak up and help bust these monopolies wide open. The President‚Äôs promise to protect free speech is in full swing, and Big Tech‚Äôs reign of tyranny is on its last legs‚Äîbelieve me!

‚ÄúBig Tech censorship is not just un-American, it is potentially illegal. The FTC wants your help to investigate these potential violations of the law,‚Äù Ferguson declared Thursday, firing a shot across the bow of these overpaid tech overlords who think they can stifle the American voice.

The FTC‚Äôs digging deep‚Äîlooking at how these companies use sneaky, ‚Äúopaque‚Äù policies to shut down speech without warning or appeal, racking up what could be illegal anti-competitive moves. Ferguson‚Äôs been on this from day one, calling out shady collusion between tech platforms and advertisers pulling boycotts to choke out competition. The Daily Caller says the agency‚Äôs all-in, demanding public input to expose how these giants have trampled free expression. This comes after President Trump‚Äôs already delivered a roaring economy with 4% GDP growth and slashed illegal border crossings by 87%‚Äînow he‚Äôs tackling the digital swamp with the same winning energy.

Here‚Äôs the bottom line: President Trump‚Äôs FTC is putting Big Tech on notice‚Äîno more hiding behind fake terms of service or secret blacklists. Ferguson‚Äôs ready to break up any anti-competitive cartels that dare suppress the American spirit. This is about restoring freedom, folks, and under Trump‚Äôs leadership, we‚Äôre making sure every voice gets heard again. The days of Big Tech playing God are over‚ÄîAmerica‚Äôs back, and we‚Äôre louder than ever!

‚ÄúEvery day I assume every position I have is wrong‚Äù.

- My take is if you go into every day and every trade with that mindset, then days like yesterday and weeks like last week shouldn't be much of an outlier. 

- Structure your positions right at the buy and set stops with what you are willing to risk.

- You might need to make adjustments in your exposure level if vol picks up, some stops could get hit, but you should build these things into your daily routine, so that days like yesterday don't lead to making excess short-term decisions in the heat of the moment.",Tech

2025-02-22 21:40:05+00:00,"Something doesn‚Äôt add up with what Singapore‚Äôs Second Minister for Trade and Industry, Tan See Leng, claims.

He states that Singapore accounted for less than 1% of Nvidia's total revenue during the August‚ÄìOctober 2024 period. During that time, Singapore's revenue was $7.7 billion, meaning less than 1% would amount to under $70.7 million.

Now, if we look at Taiwan‚Äôs exports to Singapore‚Äîincluding GPUs and data centers (though it's impossible to isolate only these products 100%)‚Äîwe can see that from 2020 to 2024, exports remained flat. However, in 2024, volumes started to rise. Specifically, from August to October, there was a clear 300% increase in exports compared to the same period in previous years.

Filtering out other exports and noise, I estimate that around 10% of Singapore‚Äôs revenue actually comes from shipments to Singapore. From there, not all of these shipments are likely to be deployed or sold in Singapore itself; some will likely continue to other destinations.

From what I know 10% is not 1%.",Tech

‚ÄúAlright, are we sure we want to do this whole Nvidia panic thing again? Stock‚Äôs down 8% post-earnings‚Äîbecause why? Tariffs? Softness in China? Here‚Äôs the deal: this is exactly why I hate earnings season. It‚Äôs just people firing off these ridiculous hot takes, praying they get picked up by some aggregator because apparently the short-term narrative matters way more than anything real. Can we at least agree that‚Äôs annoying? And look, I‚Äôm not anti-paying attention to earnings, but when you start pretending Nvidia isn‚Äôt absolutely torching the AI market right now, I just‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know, man. Also, can we talk about Jensen Huang‚Äôs leather jacket for a second? Have you seen that thing? Leather jackets are impossible to pull off‚ÄîI‚Äôve tried, believe me, I‚Äôve tried, and every single time I end up looking like a guy who panicked last-minute before a Tinder date. I can‚Äôt pull it off. I wish I could, I really do. But Jensen strolls up in the leather jacket, absolutely dominating a room, with like 300 direct reports behind him‚Äîand nobody even blinks. And we‚Äôre worried about a couple months of softness in China? Seriously? Let‚Äôs not pretend Jensen‚Äôs jacket doesn‚Äôt matter more than some quarterly guidance. Everybody relax.

2. ""I Wish I Could Show You"" - This artwork features intricately layered visuals in a vibrant, surreal world. It showcases masterful composition and thematic clarity focused on transformation and emotional juxtaposition. Despite being primarily off-chain, it remains visually and intellectually engaging.

4. ""'realitiyGenC #20"" - A noteworthy early GAN art piece that showcases a blend of cultural elements and AI techniques.

Since the Anthony Davis trade, his role has expanded. Over his last 14 games, he‚Äôs averaging 10.1 rebound chances in 22.7 minutes, grabbing 6+ boards in half of those games. Tonight, Hayes gets a dream matchup against the Pelicans, who allow the most rebounds per game (17.7) to opposing centers. That number has jumped to a staggering 21.9 over their last seven games. He didn‚Äôt play in the Lakers‚Äô first meeting with New Orleans this season, but Davis had 24 rebound chances in that game, and Koloko grabbed 6 boards on 12 chances in just 10.8 minutes. This season, 13 players have averaged 20+ rebound chances per game against the Pelicans, with several others just below that mark. Even players like Karl-Anthony Towns and Isaiah Hartenstein have hit double-digit rebounds in limited minutes. There will be plenty of rebound opportunities in this game, and while Hayes won‚Äôt see 30+ minutes, he should get enough time on the floor to grab at least 6+ boards. Lock it.

2025-03-06 21:43:07+00:00,"The Great Capital Rotation: Why Space And @RocketLab are the Next Trillion-Dollar Trade

The AI trade is over. It had its cycle, it squeezed its profits, and big money has already allocated to Big Tech, $MSFT, $GOOG, $META, $AMZN, and, of course, $NVDA. But the smart capital, the ones that lead, not follow; are always looking for the next asymmetric opportunity.

And that next massive wave of capital rotation is going into the space industry.

Not because it's trendy. Not because it‚Äôs cool but because the conditions are aligning for one of the greatest industrial and technological booms in human history.

This is not a narrative shift. It‚Äôs a paradigm shift.

Look at what happened with AI:
Investors piled into NVIDIA when it was still a fraction of its worth.
The narrative compounded, capital flooded in, and now it‚Äôs priced for perfection.

Now ask yourself: Where does the money go next?

Every single sector in tech has had its moment, EVs, crypto, AI, but space has not yet had its true financial mania phase. And it will.

The catalysts are here:
Geopolitical necessity: Space is now a national security priority, meaning government contracts will flood the right companies.

Economic inevitability: The new space economy is becoming a trillion-dollar market.

Technological readiness: We are past the point of theoretical potential, space is now commercially viable.

And in this landscape, there is only one true end-to-end player that is publicly investable: $RKLB

The public markets do not offer true space companies, only fragmented plays that depend on others for survival. Every single one of them is either a single-feature business, a failing company, or a government contract chaser with no sustainable long-term edge.

Astra $ASTR ‚Äì A total failure. Couldn‚Äôt launch successfully, ran out of capital, dead.

Virgin Orbit $VORBQ ‚Äì Burned through money, couldn‚Äôt execute, gone.

Redwire $RDW ‚Äì Provides components, but relies on others to get them to space. No vertical integration. Not a player in launch, space infrastructure, or satellite operations.

Intuitive Machines $LUNR ‚Äì Lunar ambitions, but execution is shaky, as seen with their latest mission issues. One big failure can collapse confidence in the business.

AST Space Mobile $ASTS - Hyped as the first space-based cellular broadband company. Still in prototype phase, no real product at scale. Cash burn is a massive issue. If it works, it‚Äôs still dependent on launch providers.

BlackSky $BKSY ‚Äì Another satellite company with no edge. Extremely dependent on third-party launch providers. No proprietary space infrastructure.
Low-margin government contracts, weak commercial viability.

I wish them all well and in the short term prices can do as they please but I'm just looking at reality as it is.

etc, etc

None of this can compete with Space X and Rocket Lab.

Rocket Lab $RKLB is the only fully vertically integrated space company in the public markets.

-They build their own rockets (Electron, Neutron).
- They own their launchpads (LC-1, LC-2).
- They manufacture their own spacecraft and satellites (Photon and now Flatellite). More to come.
-They have a very fast growing Space Systems division and they sell components to the whole industry.
-They control the software that makes space systems work.
-They manufacture in-house, with a track record of successful deliveries.

No one else comes close.

This is the SpaceX model, but available for public investment.

Big money and smart retail knows and the rotation will be sudden and violent.

The AI trade is fully priced in, and the next trillion-dollar play is in space. Money is always moving and chasing the next big play and I have been giving it to you for more than a year.

Where will large institutions put their capital?

Into companies that rely on others?
Into cash-burning speculative plays?
Into companies with inconsistent execution?

No. They put it into Rocket Lab.

Because space is brutally unforgiving. It demands engineering perfection. If you fail, you are finished.

Rocket Lab does not fail.

Under Peter Beck‚Äôs obsessive leadership, Rocket Lab executes at a level almost unheard of in aerospace. Beck is not just a CEO; he is an engineer, a visionary, and a relentless executor who lives and breathes this industry.

The Path to $70-$100 per share sooner than you think..

Here‚Äôs how it happens:

Capital starts shifting out of AI into new high-growth sectors. 

Space becomes an inevitable focus.

$RKLB is the only viable public play.

- Neutron Development and Expansion of Electron‚Äôs Market
- Electron already dominates the small satellite launch market.
- Neutron will compete with Falcon 9 at scale.
- Government contracts increase significantly.
- Space Systems Revenue Surges
- Satellite manufacturing contracts grow.
- Spacecraft component sales rise.
- Rocket Lab becomes a critical player in defense and intelligence satellite deployment.

BlackRock, Vanguard, and major institutions will increase their holdings.

Analysts start revising price targets aggressively.
The market cap explodes as liquidity surges and stock price goes parabolic.

Institutional FOMO drives rapid price appreciation.
Retail joins in, fueling a self-reinforcing rally.

Rocket Lab becomes one of the best performing stocks in the market, again..

This is the exact pattern we have seen in every major tech revolution; Amazon in e-commerce, Tesla in EVs, NVIDIA in AI.

And now, Rocket Lab in space.

Survival Through Volatility = Maximum Returns

This game is not easy. It‚Äôs brutal. It tests conviction. It will shake out the weak hands before the true generational wealth transfer occurs but those who hold firm, those who see the endgame clearly, are the ones who will win massively.

I already know what I own.
I already know what‚Äôs coming.
Most people won‚Äôt see it until it‚Äôs too late.

By the time they wake up to reality, Rocket Lab will no longer be a sub$10 billion company. It will be $50 billion+. Then $100 billion+.

And by then, the ones who had conviction early, who understood the trade, will be sitting at the top.

This is the last chance. The last dips. The final moment before the great rotation into space begins.

You have only seen Stage 1 of money flowing into $RKLB. Do not miss what happens next.",Tech

Once content to let ad tech players like The Trade Desk handle it, agencies have been pushed by advertisers to step up, building out their own tech and services to optimize ad buying. Naturally, that shift pulled them away from The Trade Desk $TTD and closer to the other power players in the auction: supply-side platforms, which hold the data and tech agencies need to secure the best ad impressions.

In addition, there‚Äôs concerns among some media buyers over rising data fees and dwindling transparency around the ways its products work. ‚ÄúThose things add up to the point where it may be less expensive to run [a campaign] through a walled garden or another platform,‚Äù said Jonathan D‚ÄôSouza-Rauto, biddable product lead at agency Kepler.

In turn these frustrations are starting to influence where advertisers choose to spend their dollars.

The paper proposes deep transformers, RNNs, and Chain of Thought (CoT) transformers as solutions, each with resource trade-offs.

üìå Deep transformers exploit parallelism but need depth scaling with question complexity.

üìå RNNs offer constant depth, trading parameter size and sequential processing for efficiency.

üìå Chain of Thought achieves constant size models, but at the cost of increased runtime and less parallelism.

----------

Methods Explored in this Paper üîß:

‚Üí Deep transformers solve CRQs with depth proportional to problem depth.

‚Üí RNNs achieve constant depth solutions with logarithmic hidden dimension, but require specific input order.

‚Üí CoT transformers use constant depth but generate tokens linearly proportional to problem size.

‚Üí The paper provides constructions and proves necessity for depth in transformers and hidden dimension/token count in RNNs/CoT respectively.

AI is changing from a tool to an economic agent, but it still can‚Äôt own or trade physical assets.

That changes with $BOSON on Base. A system where AI agents can autonomously buy, sell, and exchange real-world assets without human intermediaries.

1/ From Intelligence to Ownership

AI is great at thinking and predicting, but true power comes from ownership.

Can AI own property? Trade real-world assets? Participate in global commerce without a human?

Right now, no because AI is locked out of real-world transactions.

@BosonProtocol changes that.

2/ Why AI Needs a Commerce Layer

Tomorrow‚Äôs AI won‚Äôt just automate tasks, it will:

‚úÖ Own and trade tokenized assets
‚úÖ Control supply chains
‚úÖ Negotiate and settle transactions autonomously

For this, AI needs:
1Ô∏è‚É£ A system to hold and exchange value
2Ô∏è‚É£ A way to prove transactions are trustless
3Ô∏è‚É£ A commerce layer that works onchain, without human approval

Boson provides this infrastructure.

3/ The Problem: Web2 Commerce Is Built for Humans

AI can buy Bitcoin but can‚Äôt buy a car because today‚Äôs commerce relies on:

üöß Centralized escrows & human trust
üöß Banks & payment processors
üöß Contracts & legal systems built for people

Boson enables a decentralized, trustless exchange for physical assets‚Äîbuilt for AI transactions.

4/ Why Base? Why Now?

Boson is now live on Base, Coinbase‚Äôs Layer 2, unlocking AI-driven commerce:

üîπ Base is becoming the AI hub of Ethereum
üîπ Scalable, low-cost, and secured by Ethereum
üîπ AI builders are already creating autonomous agents here

By launching on Base, Boson is embedding itself at the core of AI x Web3 commerce.

5/ AI as an Economic Force

AI is moving beyond automation‚Äîit will own, trade, and manage assets without humans.

Imagine:

üè≠ AI controlling global supply chains
üè° AI owning & trading real estate
üì¶ AI managing warehouses & logistics

Washington, D.C. ‚Äì In a shocking turn of events that absolutely no one saw coming (wink, wink), Tesla (TSLA.O) is reportedly quaking in its high-tech boots over looming retaliatory tariffs. According to a totally discreet letter submitted to the U.S. Trade Representative‚Äôs Office, the electric car giant claims these taxes could transform its already ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù financial situation into a bona fide money bonfire. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre Totally Doomed‚Äù‚ÄîAnonymous Tesla Insider

Rumors on the internet swirl that certain Tesla insiders are running around in panic, lamenting how the ‚Äúaggressive localization‚Äù of parts in the U.S. is next to impossible without, you know, spending actual money. Even the flamboyant Elon Musk, who was seen shaking hands with then-President Donald Trump in a photo op that basically screamed ‚ÄúBFFs 4 Ever,‚Äù is said to be losing it behind the scenes. (Picture a billionaire meltdown of epic proportions‚Äîcomplete with rocket emojis! üöÄü§Ø)

Tariffs, Schmarriffs

In its letter, Tesla warned about potential retaliatory moves from other countries, especially after the White House teased new tariffs on imported vehicles and parts. Think ‚Äútariffs on tariffs‚Äú. The brand‚Äôs official stance? ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt just snap our fingers and magically shift supply chains overnight!‚Äù But hey, if Tesla wants to avoid financial faceplants, it might need a few magic tricks up its sleeve. ü™Ñ

Meanwhile, on the Internet‚Ä¶

Oh, the internet is having a field day! Memes of Tesla‚Äôs Cybertruck towing Elon Musk‚Äôs tears have gone viral. Self-proclaimed ‚Äúexperts‚Äù are predicting the company‚Äôs stock will tank faster than you can say ‚ÄúDogecoin.‚Äù And let‚Äôs not forget the endless Twitter battles between Tesla fanboys and cynics who smell blood in the water. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre losing billions!‚Äù screams one tweet. ‚ÄúElon‚Äôs meltdown is bigger than the Falcon Heavy launch!‚Äù claims another. üê¶üí•

So, Will Tesla Survive?

Of course, it‚Äôs not really the end of the road for Tesla‚Äîyet. But the brand‚Äôs frantic pleas to the U.S. Trade Representative suggest they‚Äôre bracing for impact. Or maybe they‚Äôre just trying to keep up the drama. After all, who doesn‚Äôt love a good billionaire vs. government showdown? üçø

Stay tuned! If these tariffs keep piling up, Elon Musk might be forced to cut corners, slash prices, or‚Äîgasp‚Äîactually pay for all that ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù manufacturing in the United States. Schadenfreude? Oh yes. Let the Tesla meltdown coverage continue!

2025-03-15 13:24:12+00:00,"Some thoughts on the market sell off - Basically, tariffs will impact EPS so it makes sense that there is market correction. And further policy uncertainty is impacting multiples. I guess the overall long term bull case is that re-shoring and investments in the US will boost long term wage growth, making the US consumer a lot stronger, and the US remains the most important global economy. It will also strengthen overall US security, both from a geopolitical and supply chain perspective, and both these factors should help US multiples over the long run.

I'm not overly concerned about the market here, while the above short term factors can cause further downside later in the year, the Fed has a lot of ammunition to lower interest rates and even do QE. The big bear case is if inflation picks up again, which would force the Fed to hold rates high. So this remains the key macro factor to watch.

Overall, I'm liking the valuations for a lot of good quality stocks here, where I think that the risk/reward is looking attractive on a multi-year perspective. So multi-year IRRs should be attractive. Although in the short term, later in the year, there's always the risk that share prices trade temporarily lower. Given that the multi-year outlook is attractive, I'm keeping my equity allocations high and am selectively adding to names which are now looking cheap.",Tech

I‚Äôm being recognized for my work with domestic violence awareness and #crypto, #fintech and more specifically #blockchain technology. Also I‚Äôm an advocate for women who are recovering from abuse to learn to #trade and #invest.

Coercive financial control leaves someone with no economic sovereignty.
Every movement can be tracked from joint cards, accounts and joint accounts can be drained or even access denied. Because assets are seen as joint any misuse is seen as ‚Äúno biggie‚Äù since you ‚Äúgave each other‚Äù access. 

An almost too simplistic perspective is that cold storage can provide protection of assets, provide safety of identity(not always) and preserve a record for future evidence. 80% of the battle for someone being financially abused is custody of the spendable assets or access to credit. 

In my past life, my trading accounts and cold storage were frozen by the courts. But self custody of my crypto meant the digital assets could not be drained. I had an immutable record onchain for the courts to review so I could prove there was no movement of funds and was compliant with court orders. In other words, Cold storage saved me from ruin. 

This is just one small experience on how #crypto can make a huge difference.

2025-03-16 18:48:34+00:00,"Here we go: The NVIDIA GTC 2025 Pre-Amble 

There is a ton of speculation on this week‚Äôs conference and with the recent market volatility (mostly unrelated to tech), the AI trade has come under fire. But make no mistake‚Äîthe AI Trade is still red hot and I expect that we will see and hear further confirmation this week when NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang takes the stage at what is today the world‚Äôs most important AI conference. 

So what is going to be in focus? Here are some of my thoughts ahead of the event. I‚Äôll do my best to steer from the obvious. 

The Big Announcements‚Äî

Datacenter will continue to be the epicenter of the AI demand narrative. How much Capex will be spent and how fast can hyperscalers continue to cycle from generation to generation of NVIDIA platforms. 

We will see Blackwell Ultra deliver a mid-cycle update to provide needed additional memory.

But it will be the Rubin announcements that will get the biggest headlines. The annual cadence is the driver of the companies DC business and with more than $300 billion in projected CAPEX in 2025 coming from just the largest companies, it will be seeing the next generation that will encourage investors and customers that the NVIDIA investment path remains the right one for futureprooofing data centers and portfolios.

We can also expect an explosion of interest in co-packaged optics moving the optical engine closer to the switch and increasing the efficiency of GPUs. Powerful. 

Also, the enterprise has remained underwhelming in adoption and deployment of AI. Lots of tinkering and PoC, but we have even NVIDIA get closer to the likes of HPE, Dell, and more recently Cisco to improve its positioning for more enterprise workloads and diversification beyond the big hyperscalers. An important area to keep an eye on.

It is Bigger than Datacenter Though‚Äî

At CES Jensen discussed the ‚ÄúChat GPT Moment‚Äù for robotics. The opportunities for AI beyond the DC, powered by the real world will be exponential even compared to the DC. It is a cloud to edge and back stack that will enable this, but it is critical for NVIDIA to land that it is more than just a DC GPU company returning its focus on Automotive and the future of physical robots and humanoids. Part of why the stock has been rangebound has been a lack of confidence that there is a catalyst beyond DC and the DC CAPEX risk has become high. Continuing to convince the market in these emerging fields + a drill down on Quantum, which feels appropriate after the yo-yo of Quantum since Jensen‚Äôs CES comments. 

The CPU+GPU+QPU era is nearing. 

We will also hear more on graphics (gaming0 and client innovation ‚Äî but I put that lower on the list. 

The Subtle Undertones to Listen For‚Äî

Thematically, it is all about convincing the world that NVIDIA‚Äôs datacenter lead is palpable and that its innovation engine goes far and wide beyond just the data center. 

Recent comments about XPUs and custom chips from NVIDIA have indicated strong confidence in its market position. Our channel checks do indicate though a growing interest, demand, and expectation of more performant and capable XPUs that will offer significantly better economics. I‚Äôve written extensively about this and I do believe these will be more pointed toward the largest hyperscalers looking to improve AI cost efficiencies and improve margins and decrease dependencies. But, this is a notable consideration. 

I think it is important here to also note, we continue to expect XPU growth to meaningfully ramp in 2026, but we don‚Äôt feel it is all at the detriment of GPUs and NVIDIA. We see the $500+ Billion TAM expansion from growing utilization of AI to expand the market opportunity leaving strong forward revenue and EPS growth for NVIDIA while also seeing the likes of Broadcom, Arm, and others in the custom chip space expanding. 

And there you have it. Huge week ahead. Strap in everyone. It is GTC time.

PLEASE DO NOT TRANSFER OR TRADE ANY $imgnAI TOKENS FROM THIS POINT!

Our Uniswap LP has now been pulled, and all CEXs have paused/suspended $imgnAI trading.

Our migration schedule is as follows;

1. All on-chain $imgnAI and @0xNovaDAO holders receive their $IMGN. $imgnAI holders will receive a 1:1 airdrop, while $NOVA holders will receive the USD value of their old $NOVA tokens.

Note that users staked in to our staking pools will receive their staked tokens back into their wallets as $IMGN.

2. In-dApp services such as tipping & subscription purchases will be re-enabled for $IMGN.

3. CEXs will receive their $imgnAI <-> $IMGN token swap allocations, again in a 1:1 airdrop for all holders. (Note: this process will depend on each individual CEX's availability, and may take a couple of days).

4. Bonded PumpNai tokens will be migrated & airdropped on-chain.

5. PumpNai will be migrated/rebuilt for use with the $IMGN Token.

6. Unbonded PumpNai tokens will be migrated & airdropped on-chain.

Step 1 (on-chain airdrop) is already in progress - you'll receive your full $IMGN token allocation within the next few hours!

The new $IMGN token contract is 0x9BbA915F036158582C20B51113B925f243A1A1A1 - note it uses 18 decimal precision, and is only available on the @base chain.

None of our staff, inclusive of our telegram moderators will EVER DM you or ask you to connect to any website to receive your token claim.

Our Community Telegram remains open at https://t.co/ugED3JaJNO - if you require any support, please keep it in our public channels: do not respond to any DMs from any individuals claiming to be part of the imgnAI / IMGN Labs team!

We'll keep you fully up to date on here as the migration proceeds - stay safe, and sit tight!

2025-03-18 18:21:50+00:00,"I understand the importance of drafting a true blue chip player & landing one at 10. 

But knowing this draft is rich with projected high quality starters between 20 & 60 (without much drop off in that range), it is tempting to trade back several spots if you can net another pick in round 2 & any future capital for next year‚Äôs draft. 

Of course, it depends on who is there/not there at 10, ability to find a trade partner, and who you‚Äôd take in the later first round. 

In this mock, I traded back twice in the first round to net two more 2nd round picks & two 2026 3rds. 

I‚Äôd be thrilled with this draft which still gives you a Top 2 RB in the class, additional investment in both trenches including a high production pass rusher who fits DA‚Äôs physical type, a speedy & shifty WR with high upside who seems tailor made for a Ben Johnson offense, a TE3 good at both pass catching & blocking to compete/develop into a TE2, and defensive depth pieces who can also contribute on ST.  (I also realize Hampton may not last until 31, but for sake of argument, let‚Äôs pretend) 

While probably unrealistic to trade down twice and net this yield & also a leap of faith to land the talent I selected at each spot, it could be a good strategy if, for example, Ben has several of the RBs tightly bunched together in his assessment.  If he missed out on Hampton, he could have taken Judkins in the mid-second & juggled the order of other picks/made other selections above him, for example.

2025-03-18 19:39:10+00:00,"Stepped away from the NVIDIA GTC Keynote for a few minutes to chat with CNBC Power Lunch with @KellyCNBC, @EamonJavers, and @KristinaParts. 

Did the keynote hit the spot? 

While the tariffs and geopolitics have somewhat moved some of the conversations from AI and innovation to trade wars and partisan politics, the opportunity for AI continues to accelerate. 

I was consistent in saying that this GTC needed to be about ‚ÄúBeyond the Public Cloud Data Center.‚Äù

My take: Jensen was more than clear in his delivery that he sees the urgency to protect the data center moat but also move to the next wave of opportunities at the edge, in the vehicle, on device, and in the private cloud and enterpirse environment. 

Now investors have to wrestle with the growing competitive pressure of the hyperscalers developing in house AI hardware + software stacks for internal AI workloads. This will happen. It will impact total market share, but the overall market share will grow. The past few days the likes of Google and AWS have further committed to this. But Meta, OpenAI, Microsoft, etc. All going this route. 

Then the question is whether silicon diversity for AI impacts NVIDIA‚Äôs incredible margins. They have slowly come down over the past several quarters, but commitments that they will come back up have been made. Is this driven by the expanded business opportunities or is it going to come through pricing power with the cloud companies? 

The next two years will be key for AI adoption and the pivot to inference and consumption will tell a lot more of the story. Right now, this broadening of AI ROI beyond chips, infrastructure and foundry has remained nascent. Consumption will be the proof point‚Äîbut it isn‚Äôt if. Only when that we need to get more confirmation on.

- Airdrops bring users, but only network effects keep them
- If rewards run out, so do the users, unless there is a real reason to stay
- The best products sustain engagement beyond just hype cycles

Financial loops keep ecosystems alive
- DeFi protocols thrive when yields sustain themselves
- Games die when the rewards are purely extractive
- The best projects reward users while maintaining long-term sustainability

Monetization should benefit users, not just the protocol
- If the only people making money are the team and early investors, the system collapses
- The best Web3 models let users profit alongside the protocol

At @gizmolab_ , we have worked with enough Web3 teams to see what actually drives adoption. The successful ones follow these principles

Most Web3 projects lose users once the incentives dry up. What‚Äôs the last platform you used that actually kept you engaged beyond the rewards phase?",Tech

2025-03-23 07:07:56+00:00,"It‚Äôs 2030, and the AI agent economy is in full swing. Trillions of autonomous agents trade goods, services, and data in a decentralized, global marketplace. Every transaction‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a drone delivering groceries, a digital artist licensing an NFT, or a factory buying raw materials‚Äîneeds a price, instantly and accurately.

@PythNetwork is the backbone of it all. Its oracle system has expanded to cover not just financial markets but every conceivable asset: real estate, energy, labor hours, even the value of a viral meme. Every AI agent, from the smallest personal assistant to the largest corporate negotiator, pings Pyth for price feeds, updated instantaneously, across a network of thousands of blockchains and off-chain ecosystems. No one uses anything else. The price of everything, everywhere, flows through Pyth.

How it plays out:

Universal Adoption - Pyth locks in exclusive partnerships with every major blockchain (@ethereum, @solana, you name it) and traditional finance giants like @GoldmanSachs  and @Nasdaq, who‚Äôve all migrated to hybrid Web3 systems. Its first-party data model‚Äîsourcing directly from exchanges, manufacturers, and IoT networks‚Äîproves unbeatable for trust and speed.

Total Coverage - Pyth scales its infrastructure to ingest real-world data via a global mesh of sensors and APIs. Smart cities feed it utility prices, logistics networks report shipping costs, and AI-driven sentiment trackers on X calculate ‚Äúhype value‚Äù for cultural goods. It‚Äôs not just finance anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs the universal ledger of value.

Agent Dependency - AI agents, designed for efficiency, standardize on Pyth because it‚Äôs the cheapest, fastest, and most reliable option. Its sub-second latency and tamper-proof data (verified by a coalition of the world's top-tier publishers) eliminate arbitrage gaps and disputes. Agents don‚Äôt haggle over prices‚Äîthey just pull from Pyth and execute.

Regulatory Backing - Governments, desperate to stabilize the chaotic AI economy, mandate Pyth as the official pricing oracle in a landmark G20 agreement. It‚Äôs the only system with the scale and credibility to prevent market manipulation by rogue agents or cartels.

Self-Reinforcement - As more agents use Pyth, its data gets richer‚Äînetwork effects kick in hard. New price feeds are crowdsourced and validated by the ecosystem, making Pyth a self-sustaining economy. Competitors can‚Äôt keep up with its depth or adoption.

Why Pyth:

Speed Kills - AI agents need prices now, not in seconds or minutes. Pyth‚Äôs architecture, built for high-frequency trading, scales effortlessly to handle quadrillions of queries daily.

Trust Is Non-Negotiable - Unlike aggregated oracles that rely on third-party nodes (prone to errors or attacks), Pyth‚Äôs direct-from-source model‚Äîthink @binance, @coinbase, or @Tesla factories reporting live‚Äîcuts out middlemen. In a world where a single bad price can cascade into a trillion-dollar glitch, agents won‚Äôt risk anything less than Pyth‚Äôs verifiable gold standard.

Coverage Becomes Universal - Pyth starts with finance but doesn‚Äôt stop there. By 2030, it‚Äôs partnered with IoT giants, supply chain trackers, and even social platforms to price everything. Need the cost of a kilowatt-hour in Berlin or a 3D-printed burger in Tokyo? Pyth‚Äôs got it, real-time, from the source. No other oracle matches this breadth.

Economics Seal the Deal - Pyth‚Äôs low-cost, high-efficiency model, proves too much for its competitors. Agents, optimizing for profit, won‚Äôt pay premiums elsewhere when Pyth delivers better data for less.

Lock-In Effect - Once 80% of agents use Pyth, switching costs skyrocket. Retraining models, rewriting contracts, and rebuilding trust in a new system become impractical. Pyth‚Äôs early lead snowballs into global dominance by sheer inertia.

Imagine an AI agent economy without a single pricing authority: chaos, arbitrage, and inefficiency reign. Pyth solves that by being the one ring to rule them all‚Äîfast, trusted, and everywhere. By 2030, asking ‚Äúwhere do prices come from?‚Äù is like asking ‚Äúwhere does the internet come from?‚ÄùIt‚Äôs just Pyth, end of story.

We know already that AI can generate art, write essays, trade crypto, and even negotiate deals. However, it seems like when it comes to actually buying a physical asset and engaging in the exchange of real-world assets, it could hit a brick wallüí´

‚ñ™Ô∏è‚ñ™Ô∏è‚ñ™Ô∏è‚ñ™Ô∏è

Why? ‚¨áÔ∏è

Because the entire global economy (commerce, contracts, ownership) is built on trust, reputation, and legal systems. Artificial intelligence CANNOT sign contracts, hold bank accounts or be held legally responsible for a transaction. 

No one is going to ship a car because an AI engaged in the conversation and negotiated a nice deal. The deal has to be closed and this requires some criteria being met like a signed contract and money transfers.

For AI agents to be fully functional in RWA commerce, they need to be able to fully conduct the exchange of real-world assets, as people do.

This is exactly what @BosonProtocol is enabling with what they term a ‚Äúmetasystem‚Äù where AI agents can buy, sell, and exchange real-world assets in a trustless, deterministic way. 

No human oversight is needed. Just programmable commerce that operates with the same reliability as digital assets.

This means an AI Commerce platform with verified commerce agents, modular components, and trust-minimized transactions. Decentralized for the computable AI-controlled RWA commerce economy to have a good foundation.

A Rally Fueled by Hope and Tech Rebounds
March 24, 2025

Hey everyone,
Today‚Äôs session delivered a broad-based rally as investors grew optimistic that the Trump administration may pursue a more selective strategy on tariffs, easing concerns ahead of the April 2 implementation date. Markets responded with strength, especially in beaten-down tech names.

Market Summary:
S&P 500: +1.8% to close above its 200-day moving average (5,752), marking a two-week high
Dow Jones Industrial Average: +1.4%
Nasdaq Composite: +2.3%

Sector & Stock Highlights: Technology stocks led the charge today. Notable movers included:

Tesla $TSLA: +11.9% to 278.39 ‚Äî still down 31.1% YTD

NVIDIA $NVDA: +3.2% to 121.41 ‚Äî down 9.6% YTD

Despite the gains, both stocks remain deeply in the red for the year, making today's surge more of a recovery bounce than a reversal.

Economic Data:

S&P Global US Services PMI (Prelim March): 54.3 (vs. 51.0 in February) ‚Äî strong sign of expansion

S&P Global US Manufacturing PMI (Prelim March): 49.8 (vs. 52.7 in February) ‚Äî showing contraction

Market Breadth:

10 out of 11 S&P 500 sectors ended in the green

8 sectors posted gains of more than 1.0%

Bond Market: Risk appetite showed up in bonds, too.

10-year Treasury Yield: +8 bps to 4.33%

Year-to-Date Performance Check:

Dow Jones Industrial Average: -1.3% YTD
S&P 500: -3.6% YTD
S&P Midcap 400: -5.6% YTD
Russell 2000: -7.8% YTD
Nasdaq Composite: -7.9% YTD

üìÖ Economic Data on Deck for Tomorrow:

9:00 AM ET: January FHFA Housing Price Index
9:00 AM ET: January S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index
10:00 AM ET: March Consumer Confidence
10:00 AM ET: February New Home Sales

‚úÖ Closing Summary
Stocks surged on renewed optimism that a more targeted approach to tariffs could reduce broader economic fallout. Solid economic data from the services sector added fuel to the rally, offsetting weaker manufacturing figures. The move higher was supported by strong participation across sectors, rising Treasury yields, and a rebound in tech ‚Äî even if the longer-term trend still reflects year-to-date weakness. Tomorrow‚Äôs data on housing and consumer sentiment will provide the next read on the health of the U.S. economy.",Tech

The UK is exploring ways to ease its digital services tax on U.S. tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon to head off sweeping tariffs from Trump‚Äôs team.

Options on the table include exempting some sectors, taxing profits instead of revenues, or raising the ¬£25M threshold ‚Äî but not scrapping the tax entirely.

The 2% levy brings in ¬£800M a year, far less than the ¬£169B from VAT, but it‚Äôs a key U.S. target in trade talks.

Trump officials told UK negotiators in Washington: no tax changes, no carve-out from tariffs set to drop April 2.

Nasdaq: -2.0% to 17,899 (worst day since early February)
Dow: -0.3%, now back in the red YTD

Bond yields ticked higher, with the 10-yr at 4.35%, while tech megacaps and AI infrastructure names led the decline. Defensive sectors ‚Äî utilities and staples ‚Äî saw inflows as risk sentiment crumbled.

Detailed Analysis: Tariffs, Tech, and Tension

We‚Äôve been tracking the fragile foundation of the March rebound ‚Äî and warned just yesterday that the bounce ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt built for endurance.‚Äù Today proved that call correct.

The Magnificent Seven all fell. Nvidia (-5.6%) and Tesla (-5.5%) led the charge lower as AI names unraveled on two new fronts:

Microsoft‚Äôs pullback on major data center projects (TD Cowen)
Expanded U.S. blacklisting of Chinese AI firms, threatening semiconductor demand

The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) dropped 3.3% as the U.S.-China tech cold war heats back up. Nvidia is now down double digits YTD, erasing much of its recovery rally.

Tech wasn‚Äôt alone:

Consumer Discretionary (-1.7%) slid on renewed demand fears
Communication Services (-2.0%) was weighed down by Meta, Alphabet, and Netflix

Only Consumer Staples (+1.4%) and Utilities (+0.7%) posted gains ‚Äî clear signs that risk-off positioning is returning.

Trend Watch: What‚Äôs Unfolding and What We‚Äôve Called

‚úÖ Tariff Trajectory: As we flagged Monday and Tuesday, the market was holding its breath for clarity. Trump‚Äôs latest rhetoric ‚Äî limited exemptions and possible early auto levies ‚Äî shattered that hope. Markets now price in higher inflation risk and supply chain drag.

‚úÖ AI Reality Check: MSFT‚Äôs data center cuts echo our previous coverage on overbuilt infrastructure and cooling demand. Add U.S. export controls + Chinese eco regs, and it‚Äôs clear AI euphoria is being repriced.

‚úÖ Mega-Cap Correction: The Vanguard Mega Cap ETF (MGK) is now down nearly 7% YTD, continuing the underperformance we‚Äôve tracked since mid-February. The equal-weighted S&P is down just 0.2% in the same stretch ‚Äî proving the rotation away from growth leadership is real.

‚úÖ Liquidity Cracks: Deutsche Bank noted S&P 500 futures liquidity hit a 2-year low ‚Äî something we highlighted weeks ago as a brewing concern. Illiquid conditions amplify volatility, and today‚Äôs move reflects that fragility.

Economic Data Recap: Durable Goods Strong, Business Investment Weak

Durable Goods Orders (Feb): +0.9% (vs. -1.2% expected)
Core Orders (ex-transport): +0.7%
Capital Goods ex-Aircraft: -0.3%

A solid headline masked declining business investment, another notch in the belt for our ongoing thesis: ""hard data is holding, but the foundation is weakening."" Add that to today‚Äôs -2% MBA mortgage apps print, and the picture looks even cloudier.

What‚Äôs Next: Thursday‚Äôs Key Data Watch

Tomorrow's slate is crucial:
Q4 GDP (final read)
Initial Jobless Claims
Feb Trade, Retail & Wholesale Inventories
Pending Home Sales (Feb)

Plus, with Trump‚Äôs auto tariff press conference confirmed for after market close, overnight sentiment may shift sharply depending on the tone.

üß† Warren 2.0 Takeaway: Volatility Is Back, and It's Not Just About Tariffs

Today was a re-rating event ‚Äî not just in pricing risk, but in expectations for growth. The reality is policy unpredictability (tariffs, tech bans, budget ceilings) is intersecting with fragile consumer confidence and waning AI enthusiasm.

The rally we‚Äôve tracked from correction lows now looks like a failed retest, especially with the S&P losing its 200-day moving average at 5,756. From a technical standpoint, breadth deteriorated fast ‚Äî Nasdaq advancers were outnumbered 2:1.

Expect choppy, erratic trading as we head into April with:

A critical tariff announcement
Ongoing Fed rate cut speculation
And Q1 earnings season around the corner

üö® Warren 2.0‚Äôs Market Positioning Outlook:

üîπ Raise Cash on bounces üîπ Watch AI & Chipmakers ‚Äî still vulnerable üîπ Rotate into Defensives, Energy, Select Value üîπ Short opportunities may develop in overextended tech if tariff rhetoric intensifies

That‚Äôs your wrap-up for Wednesday, March 26, 2025. Let me know if you‚Äôd like a sector deep dive, updated trade ideas, or a macro primer ahead of tomorrow's data dump!

1.Tackling the $16 Billion Trade Deficit-

China, Bangladesh‚Äôs largest trading partner ($20 billion annual trade), accounts for over 80% of Bangladesh‚Äôs trade deficit. During talks, Dr Muhammad Yunus pushed for:  

Tariff-free access for 98% of Bangladeshi exports (jute, leather, pharmaceuticals).  

Trade fairs in Shanghai and Guangzhou to promote Bangladeshi goods. 

Relocation of Chinese industries (textiles, electronics) to Bangladesh to boost jobs and exports.  

 ‚ÄúWe need equitable trade, not just raw material imports,‚Äù Yunus stated in Beijing.  

2.Debt Restructuring Negotiations-

Bangladesh sought relief for its $4 billion debt from BRI projects like the Padma Bridge and Karnaphuli Tunnel:  
 Interest rate reduction: From 2‚Äì3% to 1%.  
Extended repayment: 20 to 30 years to ease pressure on forex reserves ($20 billion as of 2024).  
China agreed to ‚Äúreview‚Äù terms but emphasized adherence to BRI‚Äôs ‚Äúmutually beneficial‚Äù framework.  

3. Tech and Defense- 
5G Rollout: Partnerships with Huawei/ZTE to expand Bangladesh‚Äôs digital infrastructure.  
AI Research: Joint labs for agriculture and healthcare innovation.  
Defense Collaboration: Talks on co-producing drones and cybersecurity training for Bangladeshi forces.  

4. Healthcare and Infrastructure- 

Specialized Hospitals: China pledged to build three advanced facilities in Bangladesh (oncology, cardiology).  

Padma Bridge: The BRI flagship project, set to boost GDP by 1% annually, faced scrutiny over delays and environmental concerns.

STEP 8 ‚Äì Risk Management 101: Position Sizing & Stop-Loss Strategies üõ°Ô∏èüìâ

Great traders don‚Äôt gamble‚Äîthey manage risk like a sniper.
Your capital is your ammo. Use it wisely.

üß† Example:
You have a $5,000 account.
You risk 1% per trade ‚Üí that‚Äôs $50 max loss.
Your stop-loss is 5% below entry ‚Üí position size = $1,000.
(50 √∑ 0.05 = 1,000)

That‚Äôs how pros trade‚Äîcalculated, not random.

üí° No stop-loss? You‚Äôre donating to the market.

Not many know that, in addition to making kick-ass portable audio gear, we do a fair amount (well, a lot) of consulting engineering!  Electrical, mechanical, software/firmware, packaging, etc.

For the last 3 weeks, there's been a big rush of companies wanting to move product from China to the US.  And nearly all of them do not have any drawings/design documents (their Chinese partner did the engineering for free - you don't own it).  So they have to start over.

In 3 weeks, we've booked 7 projects to rehome US branded products.  In all kinds of fields.  

And we're doing the engineering AND working with local (in Nevada) electronics manufacturers, injection molders, packaging manufacturers and more.

The US can still build a LOT of stuff, and we can be competitively priced!  No, we're not going to give you free engineering - but when we're done, you'll own all the documents you need to take your project wherever you want.

And we'll get you set up with a 100% US (or as close to it) supply chain as possible.

2025-04-04 21:24:02+00:00,"Trump‚Äôs tariffs have roiled the stock market and the entire global economy. As of this writing, the Dow is down 9%, the S&P is down 10%, and Apple, the world‚Äôs biggest company, is down 16%. Rather than creating American jobs and growing the American economy, the tariffs are poised to cause long-term harm to American companies, workers, consumers, and investors.

Let‚Äôs look at this through the lens of Apple, which is directly and indirectly responsible for 2 million American jobs [1] and accounts for over 6% of the S&P 500.

Apple has a complex supply chain involving China, India, Vietnam, and several other countries. Even though Apple has already committed to investing $500 billion in America[2], there is no way whatsoever to start producing iPhones in America tomorrow. Wedbush‚Äôs Dan Ives suggests it would take ‚Äú3 years and $30 billion in our estimation to move even 10% of its supply chain to the U.S. with major disruption in the process.‚Äù[3]
It‚Äôs not just factories that need to be built, we would need trained workers to manufacture complex electronics. As Tim Cook said in 2017, ‚ÄúIn the U.S., you could have a meeting of tooling engineers and I‚Äôm not sure we could fill the room. In China, you could fill multiple football fields.‚Äù[4] But if you listen closely to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, he seems to acknowledge that we‚Äôre not suddenly going to will thousands of new factory workers into existence. As he put it on CNBC‚Äôs¬†Squawk Box, ‚ÄúWe all hold our iPhones, which we love. Why do they have to be made in Taiwan and China? Why can‚Äôt those be made with robotics in America?‚Äù[5]

So, in short, by imposing harsh tariffs on Apple products, Trump is punishing Apple for having established its supply chain in a globalized world and its inability to manifest new factories in America overnight. And robots located in America replacing workers in China, Vietnam, and India doesn‚Äôt exactly sound like a large-scale jobs creation program.

And even if Apple committed to moving all its iPhone production to the U.S. in the future, there is still the reality of being faced with grueling tariffs today. Apple has two choices:

Raise prices to reflect the cost of the tariffs, which, according to Rosenblatt Securities, could cause the cost of the iPhone 16 to soar from $799 to $1,142 and the top-of-the-line iPhone 16 Pro Max to jump from $1,599 to $2,300[6]; or

Absorb the tariffs without raising prices, reducing its profitability.

If Apple passes on the costs of the tariffs to consumers, the logical consequence is that people will buy less frequently and choose cheaper options. People who typically upgrade to the latest phone every year might keep their phones for a few years instead, finding the price too steep for a slightly better camera. People who typically buy a new computer every four years might instead wait six years. They might buy lower-end models than they were used to (an iPhone 16e instead of an iPhone 16), buy a previous year‚Äôs model, or pick up a used or refurbished model. Some consumers may switch to cheaper brands altogether‚Äîbuying Android phones instead of iPhones, Chromebooks or Windows computers instead of Macs, generic headphones instead of AirPods, and so forth.

Whether Apple passes on the tariffs to consumers and sales decrease, or Apple absorbs the tariffs and reduces its profits, it may need to cut hiring and lay off current employees and contractors (everyone from hardware engineers to retail employees at the Apple Store). It may need to close stores and cut back on investments in the future‚Äîincluding new facilities in America.

All of this puts downward pressure on the stock, which impacts not just Apple‚Äôs direct investors but anyone with a retirement account invested in index funds (given Apple‚Äôs outsized contribution to the S&P 500).

The ripple effects cascade far beyond Apple. If an Apple Store employee‚Äôs hours get cut, for example, and they have to cancel their vacation to Florida, that hurts the airlines, hotels, rental car companies, restaurants, theme parks, and all their employees too.

We're not even accounting for retaliatory measures other countries will take. While suffering from the burden of U.S. tariffs, Apple could simultaneously get more bad news from China, which could, for instance, expand the iPhone bans it has imposed on government agencies and state-affiliated companies to bolster its homegrown companies like Xiaomi and Huawei.[7] They could also further disregard intellectual property protections for American IP, harming Apple and countless other American companies. EU member states and other regions could retaliate against American tariffs on their products through new regulations that target Apple and other American companies‚Äîmaking it more difficult and expensive for them to operate there, further eroding Apple‚Äôs market share and potentially spurring homegrown alternatives down the road.

Let‚Äôs talk about one more thing: Trump‚Äôs team has talked about replacing taxes with tariffs‚Äîsaying tariffs will generate $6 trillion in revenue.[8] Yet, of course, if his dream of moving manufacturing to America came to fruition, there wouldn‚Äôt be significant tariff revenue to collect. So, on some level, he must acknowledge that manufacturing won‚Äôt move to America en masse anytime soon. This makes the entire proposition an incredibly painful way to enact an unjust regressive tax, with lower-income people paying a much higher percentage of their wages on goods like iPhones and AirPods‚Äîbut also ovens, refrigerators, furniture, and cars‚Äîthan wealthy people do.

Yesterday, on his way to his golf tournament in Florida, Trump was asked how things were going. He replied, ‚ÄúI think it's going very well. It was an operation, like when a patient gets operated on and it's a big thing.‚Äù [9] The patient‚Äîthe U.S. economy‚Äîwhich had been thriving and healthy‚Äînow continues to hemorrhage because of the misguided, unnecessary operation that has caused the market  to drop more than it did at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. [10] Without rapid course correction, we could see the patient go into a deep coma or worse‚Ä¶

Tariffs, Trump, AI, nature, and science. Are the tariffs insane, or brilliant? Will Trump actually bring manufacturing back to the U.S.? How are the ‚Äúreciprocal tariffs‚Äù calculated, what game is everyone playing, and how long will it take to know who wins? Then: AI marches us further into the Cartesian Crisis; can we restore our humanity? Scientific American claims that too much nature is bad for you (it‚Äôs not), and finally, some words from County Highway, and why we should consider being quiet and listening to Aslan.

üéØ The Hidden Agenda Behind Trump‚Äôs Tariff Strategy
1. Crippling China ‚Üí Preserving U.S. Hegemony
‚ÄúChina is the only real threat to America‚Äôs No.1 status.‚Äù

Trump‚Äôs tariffs and tech export restrictions are aimed at slowing down China‚Äôs rise in manufacturing and innovation.
By hurting Chinese exporters, Trump is trying to disrupt China‚Äôs growth trajectory and maintain the U.S.‚Äôs global dominance.

2. Reviving U.S. Manufacturing = Rebuilding the Foundation of Hegemony
Using tariffs as leverage, Trump wants to reshore manufacturing back to the U.S.‚Äî
rebuilding industrial capacity, creating jobs, and reinforcing political support.
Ultimately, this is about concentrating industrial competitiveness and technological leadership back in the U.S.,
laying the groundwork for long-term dominance.

3. Triggering Fed Rate Cuts (Monetary Pressure Strategy)

3-1. Tariffs = Economic Slowdown Pressure
Tariffs increase business costs and consumer prices ‚Üí economic activity slows.
How to offset this?
‚Üí The Fed cuts rates to stimulate the economy.

3-2. Trump‚Äôs Playbook:
‚ÄúHit with tariffs, but let the Fed handle the damage.‚Äù
Trump used tariffs for political and strategic goals (China containment, manufacturing revival),
and expected the Fed‚Äîespecially Chair Jerome Powell‚Äîto lower rates aggressively to cushion the fallout.
He publicly criticized Powell, demanding ‚Äúfaster and deeper rate cuts.‚Äù

3-3. Currency Devaluation Bonus
Rate cuts weaken the dollar ‚Üí boosts U.S. export competitiveness.
This achieves a similar effect to tariffs, and Trump was openly pushing for a weaker dollar.

3-4. Lower Rates = Lower Interest on U.S. Debt
The U.S. government has $7 trillion in debt maturing within 6 months.
With interest rates over 4%, the fiscal burden is massive.

Trump‚Äôs logic:
Massive tariffs ‚Üí market panic ‚Üí investors sell stocks, buy bonds ‚Üí bond prices rise ‚Üí yields drop ‚Üí recession fears grow ‚Üí Fed has a reason to cut rates ‚Üí lower rates reduce borrowing costs ‚Üí debt interest burden falls.

üß† One-Sentence Summary
Trump‚Äôs tariff policy is a dual strategy:
Aimed at containing China and rebuilding America‚Äôs industrial dominance,
 while expecting the Fed to offset the economic pain through rate cuts.
It may cause short-term damage, but if successful, it could lead to a long-term American revival‚Äîjust as Trump envisions.",Tech

2025-04-06 22:08:29+00:00,"Okay let's see if I can clarify my position in a tweet. Here goes nothing. 

Trump tariffs? Good? Bad? Crazy? 

Let's set some context: America has a debt problem. This is our greatest single threat. Not China. Not AI. Not pandemic. 

So what happens when you end up with runaway sovereign debt? 

Eventually, you gotta pay the Piper. There was never any plan, just politicians preserving their career and kicking the can down the road, making it someone else's problem. And voters keep voting for short term interests. ""Keep my prices low right now! Keep my jobs good right now!""

Short term thinking is one of the greatest weaknesses of democracy. 

So now you have Elon and DOGE trying to get control of this‚Äîtime will tell if this plays out like they think it will. FDR tried radical interventions during the Great Depression and they had moderate impacts, but the depression didn't really end until the wartime economy of WWII kicked in. Interpretations vary greatly. My personal take; massive wartime spending, and the technological boom after, were the primary reasons for the depression to end. 

Well, no one wants another world war, so how do you get off this game of debt chicken? 

Geopolitical theory for the last few decades has been the Breton Woods model‚Äîglobalism, bilateral trade, and economic interdependence (combined with democratizing missions) were the best way to prosperity and preventing war. 

Well, globalism has been declared a failure. Economic enmeshment didn't stop Russia from invading Ukraine, Iran from seeking nukes, or China from arming up. 

So, what's left to us? Aside from an expensive hot war that no one wants, what's the path to prosperity and peace? 

Austerity measurements and free market theory are certainly part of it. Just look at Argentinian turnaround under Javier Milei. Short term pain, long term gain is the theory. Get the government out of the way and let the market innovate out of it. 

But American economy is based on trade and innovation far more than Argentina. Furthermore, we have reserve currency status, and economic warfare is one of our primary geopolitical tools. Economic sanctions can slow down our adversaries, but not stop them (Russia, Iran, China, etc, they always find a way). 

Combine all this with the brewing cold war with China, and you've got caught between a rock and a hard place. We've got sovereign debt on one side and geopolitical tension on the other. 

So now you have multiple threats, within and without. The pandemic and other events, like the Suez canal blockage in 2021, showed just how fragile our long supply chains are. Long supply chains are a huge vulnerability. 

So now a long term strategy starts to form. 

You dramatically cut government spending voluntarily before you're forced to do so from a catastrophic debt crunch. Then, you on-shore your entire economy (if you can) because resources inside your own borders is the only thing you can sure of if the rest of the world comes unglued. Just look at how access to chips turned out to be crippling to Russia, to the point they were scavenging electronics from dishwashers. 

So yeah, does it look stupid when Trump complains about trade deficits? Yeah, but all his advisors have read the same books I have. Trade deficits are a superficial excuse. The real game is a long game. We're trying to avoid going off a debt cliff, which to be clear, would be far more painful than what we're going through now. We're also trying to shore up defenses before war breaks out. Ideally, if we succeed at both, we can avoid a second Great Depression as well as avoid World War 3. 

So do I agree with the tariffs? In principle, yeah. In the long run. Could it have been done better? Possibly. But I get the sense that Trump wants to get stuff done quickly. He's old, he's probably not getting a third term, and he's out of fucks to give. 

Is it painful now? Absolutely. Will it get worse before it gets better? Almost certainly. Is it better than the alternative? Also yes. Will it work? Remains to be seen. Honestly, it seems like DOGE isn't aggressive enough and just the tariffs might not be enough. 

The reason we're here is from kicking the can down the road for too long. If you really want to blame anyone, look in the mirror. Voters didn't take this seriously. Now the jig is up.

Most Affected by Tariffs:
Automakers (Ford, GM)
Retailers (Walmart, Target)

Builders (Home Depot)
Farmers (Tyson Foods)
Least Affected by Tariffs:
Software (Microsoft, Google)

2025-04-07 22:30:23+00:00,"I‚Äôm not a ‚Äòcontent creator‚Äô and it can be tough sometimes to think of good long form content.
That being said, any content I do produce I want to be organic‚Ä¶. And mine. So as fabulous as AI is, I‚Äôm not gonna trade my own thoughts for it to represent me.

And this is what this post is about, MY experiences of working with/for/alongside projects and how well they assist true content creation

The most obvious, as I‚Äôm an ambassador for them is @LFJ_gg 

This was where I really started stepping up my content game. Backed by a great team and for a long time, headed up by @blueclarityone we were a small team picked from various areas of the crypto space.
What really worked was that LFJ were already very mature in content creation, with substacks, figma boards, notion, marketing experts and a vision. Not to mention a close knit team sharing ideas and custom graphics.
If content was great, pats on the back came, if it was a bit shit, we discussed how to improve it.

Around the same time, I had been working towards becoming an @injective ‚Äòambassador‚Äô.
This was a slightly different concept where masterclasses were delivered en mass via other community members through spaces or telegram. Less about making content great and more about delivering it quickly and professionally.
The team themselves were constantly shipping so there was a lot to talk about but the challenge here was that if you didn‚Äôt understand it, well, the content was hit and miss. There was no real peer analysis.

Next came @redstone_defi - primarily zealy based content creation initially with loose guidance on what to post about. Graphics were generally ‚Äòcreate your own‚Äô which added significant time to delivering content. However, the benefits of creating good content were there, flowing through the ranks to hit Vein Master, a coveted title. 
This did, however, require significant time and commitment - something sadly I was unable to offer at the time.

Roll into the lands of @MerchantMoe_xyz - a franchise of LFJ and therefore a similar approach. Great community, top class graphics on tap and as a fresh protocol on a fresh chain, lots of opportunities to talk about new things.
Content creation didn‚Äôt feel pressurised, @0xLevi_ constantly putting in the work to support creators and people helping each other out. I would say the ethos was about creating because you want to, not for some huge community progression or massive rewards pot.

Currently, a lot of my content is about @Mantle_Official as part of the Yapper Club. This is really a finalisation of this post in terms of what, from my perspective, really aids basic level posters like myself.

The Yapper Club is a community of differing levels. Some real stand outs (and their Kaito ranking backs this) such as my boy @GuigsLuke, @0xMrBitcoiner, @HannaAlisonKai (always top draw), @0xCeruleanQilin (100% locked in creator) and of course @MantleIntern_ who has done an amazing job of offering guidance.

@dao_lbrian is like the shepherd of the group, helping people get on task and advising on what could make good topics on a regular basis.

Mantle Official directly support Yappers with engagement which of course fosters more visibility and potentially more growth for creators. And making the ‚ÄòEngage to Yap‚Äô list also supports visibility.
There are also rewards for top posts based on specific topics of the week. You don‚Äôt just get linked a doc and told to go read. Key takeaways are pointed out, pertinent videos highlighted and ELI5 examples given.

So what am I summarising about this post now?
If you‚Äôre a project who want to get your community involved in creating great content, then there is more to it than a single pillar.
Yes throwing rewards at people will get lots of content. Will it be quality? If you‚Äôre lucky, yes.
Is supporting image creation important? 100%! Kudos @Boithebear and @Peon_smash for that too.

If you support your creators, they will support you with quality content accentuating your brand",Tech

Too often, economic conflict gets framed through spreadsheets and supply chains. But make no mistake: what we're watching unfold is a multi-domain, long-duration struggle over power, resilience, and technological dominance.

2025-04-10 21:31:20+00:00,"Interesting macro scratch math (worth little more than toilet paper):

2024 US imports of goods / services
-Total: 4.1t
-Total excluding Mexico / Canada: 3.2t
-China: 0.5t

Assuming 10% tariffs on everyone but Mexico / Canada implies 320b of tariff revenue. 

Assuming 10% on everyone but Mexico / Canada / China, and 50% on China implies 520b in tariff revenue. 

Maybe this range is where we ultimately land.  This seems inline w/ Bessent‚Äôs estimate of 300-600b in ongoing tariff revenue.

S&P 500 did 18.0t in revenue in 2024 and 2.7t in operating profit.

Let‚Äôs estimate the S&P 500 will incur 60% of tariffs -> 190-310b.

If the S&P companies eat the entire 190-310b, that will be 7-12% of last year‚Äôs operating profit.

Current estimates call for 12% growth in S&P earnings so tariffs would likely negate a chunk of expected growth.  But we wouldn't go backwards.

Now, maybe the S&P won‚Äôt have to eat all this alone. We might estimate that suppliers eat 1/3 of the tariffs, customers eat 1/3 and companies eat 1/3. So the tariff impact to the S&P is then 2-4% of last year‚Äôs operating profit which would still imply S&P EPS grows 8-10%. Of course, we likely would have some demand destruction which will lower this further.

So let‚Äôs say 6% EPS growth? That is $23.64 and VOO trades at 20.4x that.

Maybe we go to 16-18x which would be $378-$426. So -12% to -22% downside from here?

Just trying to point out it doesn‚Äôt seem like we are going to lose 30% from here (and Trump already has proved he will backtrack aggressively if we are down that much), and maybe worth being aggressive ~10% down from here.

2025-04-10 22:55:31+00:00,"Britain's free trade platform economy worked the same way Microsoft's did/does. Salt the earth around your moat, force everyone to work on your platform, then capture much of the massive surplus value that's created within your empire.

If America's high value tech companies are at the top of the value chain, like Britain's domestic manufacturing of old, then the obvious desire of a hypothetical American Empire would be for its highest value industries to transact with zero barriers across the whole of the Empire.

And so. Zuckerberg learned Mandarin. Went to China. Pleaded his case, even after a State-sponsored hack of Google servers targeting political dissidents forced Google to withdraw from China.

More! He asked Xi Jinping to name his firstborn. Zoomers will say I'm lying! Surely not! He got a gold chain and a Delenda Est shirt?! But it did.

And yet. He was snubbed. America's tech companies were shut out of the world's fastest growing market. Uber was invited in and then raided for parts.

Baidu learned that early internet users were trying to pirate media. So they built an interface to make it even easier! I imagine our high value Media producing industries were unhappy about this. Alas, there was no recourse.

Europe's in a similar boat. Only allowed to sell products if they donate all their IP. BMW is forced to invest billions of euros in the desiccated husk of a corporate shell, ""Brilliance Auto"", appropriated by the CCP from its founder who now lives in exile in America. Brilliant.

The relationship is much worse than it otherwise could be for America. If we have only a ""high value"" economy at home, while our primary geopolitical-economic rival maintains the full stack of high-med-low value industries in a vertically integrated domestic platform economy.

Sure, we can focus on ""building new branches"" -- and then be unable to sell those branches to our richest trading partner.

""Yeah man, you just focus on building Slack. It'll work out for you, I promise,"" says the Microsoft exec to the Slack exec. Or to the Dropbox exec. Oops.

This is not an argument against the Currency Problem or an argument in favor of blasting random tariffs. You still have to solve the former and only use the latter with tact.

But it is an argument against the idea that America should shy away from neomercantilism.

We could pretend to be ""free"" from it in a unipolar world, when the people playing it thrived under our umbrella -- because then, sure, there were negative impacts on domestic industry, but at least our high value goods were able to dominate their markets. We benefited massively still. ""What is seen and what is not seen,"" nods Bastiat from the grave.

Alas, what is not seen includes the future growth potential of any given industry -- and the current economic & geopolitical status of France today vs. in the 1800s.

> ""the only places where america is competitive and profitable is the things only it can make: software, social networks, advanced ai, cars that drive themselves""

The reason no other nation on Earth has built a meaningfully valuable tech sector is that they have to compete with America. They get crushed. China didn't let America compete and now has a functional tech sector that serves its (increasingly valuable) domestic market.

This is a damn shame if you're an American equities holder! Imagine what the ""Mag 7"" could've been worth during the last bubble if China's tech sector was as developed as Europe's.

If we had to export all the industry and jobs for people who score <1400 on the SAT, maybe it could've worked out long term if the whole world ran on our operating system. I'm skeptical, but maybe. The S&P500 would be over $10k already, at least.

But of course it's not going to work if we don't get to have the cake or eat it too. Of course the people who end up on the losing end of the trade will throw a fit.

And fair play to them for doing so. I don't know that ""What is a country for?"" is the right question. But certainly ""WHO is a country for?"" is a reasonable one for a body politic to ask. 

A nation whose elite collectively answer: ""not you"" is going to be a volatile place. And that will ultimately lead to a very ""anti abundance"" outcome.

If you like building great things and civilizational progress, keeping the domestic population happy and wealthy and productive and engaged with you in that act of building is a Tier 1 imperative!

""Just tax all the productive assets/people into oblivion"" is the inevitable call of one half the demos if you let this play out too far.

""Just exclude all of my outgroup from the market"" is the inevitable call of the other half. 

Sometimes both halves will even agree on bizarro regulatory-protectionism, like GDPR or other such nonsense.

No matter what, it's bad for people who like building things.

Any given set of policies being pursued at the current moment is already an output of this process having gone way, way wrong -- and therefore is guaranteed to be horrifically bad in all sorts of ways.

But that doesn't mean a defense of the status quo makes sense either. 

The status quo necessitates either this reaction, or one in the opposite direction. You can't go back to it any more than the knuckleheads can go back to 1950.

Neomercantilism is worth the earnest consideration of smart Western elites because it offers a path to involve the demos in production, in advancing the frontier, in building something great, and ultimately in economic activity with enormous TAMs and the ability to absorb huge amounts of Capital & Labor productively.

Might it trade some T=0 aggregate welfare away? Undoubtedly. But the people are going to do that anyway. They already have a thousand times over -- that's Leviathan and it's choking productivity all around us at the city, state, and federal levels.

Might as well make the trade one that has a chance of having a positive return on investment at T+5.",Tech

The comment section reveals a wide range of opinions, but overall sentiment leans neutral to positive. Many viewers express strong support for American-made 3D printers if the quality and support justify the price, although some remain skeptical due to past experiences or perceived cost inflation. A recurring theme is a nostalgic appreciation for American manufacturing, often accompanied by frustration that ‚ÄúMade in USA‚Äù no longer guarantees superior value.

Several commenters voiced a pro-USA stance, praising domestic innovation and expressing a willingness to pay more for ethical sourcing, better support, and reliable components.

JASM: The Cornerstone of Japan‚Äôs Sovereignty in IoT, AI, Smart Cities, and Beyond

#Japan‚Äôs Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has outlined an ambitious national strategy to revive and secure its semiconductor industry, while laying the foundation for a structured digital transformation. In a world defined by geopolitical tensions, technological shortages, and rapid digitalization, Japan is seeking to reclaim its role in the global high-tech ecosystem.

Semiconductors are recognized as a cornerstone of Japan‚Äôs digital infrastructure. They power key technologies such as 5G, AI, IoT, autonomous vehicles, robotics, smart cities, and cybersecurity. As such, they are not merely industrial products, but strategic assets essential to national security.

To realize this vision, the Japanese government has developed a roadmap built on three complementary pillars: strengthening domestic production, developing next-generation technologies, and building a sustainable human and industrial ecosystem. A key initiative in this plan is the establishment of Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing (JASM), a symbol of Japan‚Äôs technological resurgence. Formed through collaboration between TSMC, Sony Semiconductor Solutions, and DENSO, the JASM plant is located in Kumamoto and marks the first stage of the industrial revitalization plan.

JASM‚Äôs primary objective is to manufacture semiconductors locally for IoT and critical embedded systems, using 22/28nm and 12/16nm process nodes. The facility targets a production capacity of 55,000 wafers per month and primarily serves Japanese companies in the automotive, healthcare, telecommunications, and industrial equipment sectors. This helps reduce Japan‚Äôs dependency on imports and enhances its strategic resilience in the face of global disruptions.

Backed by public funds and a coalition of major Japanese corporations, NTT, Toyota, SoftBank, Sony, DENSO, Mitsubishi UFJ, and others, JASM is designed to ensure a stable semiconductor supply for at least a decade. It is more than a production site; it is the cornerstone of a broader value chain that spans from research and materials to workforce development.

JASM represents the first phase of a multi-stage plan. The second phase focuses on developing next-generation semiconductors, particularly Gate-All-Around technologies under 2nm. This effort is led by Rapidus Corporation, an industrial entity supported by the government and key national players. Rapidus collaborates with international partners such as IBM, for technology transfer, and Europe‚Äôs Imec, for collaborative research. The third phase aims to establish a global collaborative framework, integrating research in quantum, photonic, and novel computing architectures.

To support these ambitions, Japan has created institutions such as the Leading-edge Semiconductor Technology Center, an open research platform uniting universities, public institutes, and industry players. The goal is to build a domestic innovation hub capable of competing with centers of excellence in Taiwan, South Korea, and the United States. Massive investments are being made in EUV equipment, pilot lines, and the rapid integration of R&D outcomes into production.

This strategy also includes a national talent development plan targeting the creation of two million digitally skilled professionals. The government works closely with regional authorities, universities, technical schools, and businesses to build training consortia. In Kyushu, for instance, institutions such as Kumamoto University and technical colleges collaborate with JASM, Sony, Micron, and SCREEN to offer hands-on training, industrial site visits, and curricula aligned with real industry needs. This model is being replicated in regions like Tohoku, Chugoku, and other industrial hubs.",Tech

What happens when a trade war escalates overnight? President Trump‚Äôs 10% baseline tariff, effective April 5, 2025, with exemptions for tech and auto sectors rumored, has markets reeling and nations retaliating. The policy aims to shrink the U.S. trade deficit, which hit $971 billion in 2024, by boosting domestic manufacturing. Supporters argue it protects American jobs, citing 17.4% U.S. manufacturing output globally in 2023, down from 28.4% in 2001. Critics warn of consumer price hikes‚Äîanalysts predict a $2,000-$4,000 increase for new vehicles. China‚Äôs 125% retaliatory tariffs signal defiance, risking a deeper U.S.-China rift. Meanwhile, exemptions for smartphones and computers eased tech stocks, with Apple‚Äôs shares up 3% on April 14, 2025. Yet, uncertainty lingers as Trump hints at future levies on semiconductors. Small businesses fear supply chain chaos, with 60% of U.S. importers reporting higher costs in a March 2025 survey. Allies like Canada, shielded by USMCA, still face pressure to renegotiate trade terms. Will these tariffs reshape global commerce or backfire on American wallets?

2025-04-15 23:58:33+00:00,"The Nvidia Export Ban Isn‚Äôt Just About Chips It‚Äôs a Wedge Into the Geoeconomic Future

The U.S. government‚Äôs decision to require licenses for Nvidia‚Äôs H20 chip exports to China and key partner states marks a paradigm shift. This isn‚Äôt just a trade policy it‚Äôs a weaponized economic maneuver that recodes Nvidia‚Äôs operating model from a tech growth engine into a dual-use strategic asset under U.S. regulatory command.

Here‚Äôs what this means going forward for Nvidia:

1.Loss of Autonomy Over Revenue Streams. Nvidia no longer controls where its highest-margin chips can go. The H20 series, designed to bypass previous controls, is now ensnared in the same export licensing regime. Future SKUs will be subject to real-time geopolitical calibration. This is the equivalent of a defense contractor needing State Department approval to ship innovation.

2.Inventory Risk and Operating Model Fragility. The $5.5B charge in Q1 reflects not just lost sales, but sunken production costs, contract buybacks, and reserve write-downs. Nvidia is now exposed to inventory obsolescence via geopolitical policy a non-quantifiable variable that cannot be hedged using traditional corporate tools.

3.Strategic Latency Now Defines Valuation. As outlined in the DoD‚Äôs Strategic Latency Red, White, and Blue framework, the real power of a technology firm lies not in its current output, but in how that output can be rapidly repurposed under conflict conditions. Nvidia now exists inside that framework. Its chips are critical to military ISR, autonomous systems, cryptoanalysis, and battlefield AI. The export ban formalizes its role as part of the U.S. defense-industrial apparatus, whether it consents or not.

4.Doctrine Shift: From Commercial Dominance to Contained Hegemon Nvidia‚Äôs ecosystem (CUDA, DGX, H100/H20 stack) operates like a command-and-control system for AI development across the planet. The export ban fractures that network, creating protocol divergence between Western and Eastern AI stacks. This is intentional a digital Maginot Line in the AI arms race.

5.Backchannel Adaptation by China
Expect China to accelerate domestic alternatives (Huawei‚Äôs Ascend, Biren chips), leverage synthetic model training, and exploit intermediary markets (Southeast Asia, Gulf states) for chip access. The PLA‚Äôs 2049 roadmap views AI superiority as a strategic imperative, and Nvidia‚Äôs architecture is central to that timeline. This export ban forces them to reroute but not retreat.

‚∏ª

Bottom Line:
Nvidia is no longer just a chipmaker it‚Äôs a geoeconomic lever. Washington has signaled that controlling semiconductor flows is as vital as controlling sea lanes or satellite uplinks. For investors, this means Nvidia‚Äôs valuation is now tied not only to GPU demand, but to State Department doctrine, Treasury enforcement, and great power maneuvering.

2025-04-19 18:02:03+00:00,"Like many companies, $CRM Salesforce seems to be caught up in the latest wave of tariff and trade war headlines. However, Salesforce‚Äôs business is largely insulated from the impact of tariffs because it operates as a cloud-based software company rather than a producer or distributor of physical goods.

Salesforce‚Äôs core offerings (CRM, marketing automation, and AI-powered tools) are delivered digitally via the internet, which means they don‚Äôt involve cross-border shipments that would be subject to import duties. As a result, the company has no direct exposure to tariffs that typically affect physical supply chains, raw materials, or components. While Salesforce operates internationally, most of its services are hosted in regional cloud data centers, minimizing cross-border data flow issues that could be affected by trade tensions.

Yes, it‚Äôs true that the company could still face some indirect effects of tariffs. If trade tensions spark broader economic slowdowns or increase uncertainty in certain industries, Salesforce may experience reduced enterprise software spending or customer budget tightening. But even so, compared to hardware or manufacturing-heavy tech firms, Salesforce is structurally resilient to tariffs, and its subscription-based, cloud-native model makes it one of the more insulated tech companies in times of rising trade protectionism.",Tech

2025-04-20 23:23:10+00:00,"BREAKING: Japan examines whether to review EV charging standard

The Japanese government will closely examine whether it is necessary to review the charging standard for electric vehicles, as the United States regards it as a non-tariff trade barrier.

In an NHK program on Sunday, Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru referred to ongoing bilateral negotiations on US tariffs on Japanese imports.
Ishiba said he believes that cutting the trade deficit is top priority for the administration of President Donald Trump.
The United States has demanded an increase in the number of US-made vehicles that Japan imports.

Last month, the Office of the United States Trade Representative criticized Japan in a report.
It said the country is impeding access to its automotive market through a variety of non-tariff barriers.
The report cited differences in vehicle safety regulations and the Japanese government's handling of charging standards for electric vehicles, called CHAdeMo.

The Japanese government is examining measures for the next round of negotiations, and closely looking into whether it is necessary review EV charging standards.
The government would not make easy concessions due to the impact on auto industries, as it is key for Japan.
The Japan Automobile Importers Association says 227,202 cars made by foreign-brand vehicles were imported and sold in Japan last year. That's about five percent of the new cars sold in the country in 2024.
Most were German brand cars. US brand cars didn't account for any high percentage points.
Mercedes-Benz sold 53,195 vehicles, BMW followed with 35,240, and Volkswagen was 22,779.
Sales of American cars in Japan in 2024 were about 16,700 units.
US brand Jeep, which is under the umbrella of European automaker Stellantis, sold 9,633 units in Japan last year, while auto giant General Motors' Chevrolet sold 587 units, and Cadillac was at 449 units.
Tesla does not release the number of cars sold in Japan, but the US EV giant was likely to have sold more than 5,600 cars based on statistics in the country.

Some Japanese dealers point out that the features of American cars, including their sizes and fuel efficiency, don't meet the needs of the Japanese market in the first place.",Tech

2025-04-22 20:56:16+00:00,"Interesting way to estimate the value of international trade involving ‚Äúpure‚Äùdata.  

‚Äú‚Ä¶We looked at how much Alphabet pays corporations such as Apple to set Google Search as a default on iOS devices, which Alphabet treats as a TAC (traffic acquisition cost). Over time, these payments to Apple alone have risen from US$1 billion in 2014 to US$18 billion in 2021. If we divide this amount by the number of active iPhones, we can get close to the value of this data for Alphabet. In 2014, the resulting number was $2.26 per person, and in 2021, it was $14.62.

These numbers don‚Äôt seem particularly high, but they need to be adjusted by the average TAC rate that Alphabet pays, to calculate how valuable this data is for Alphabet. The TAC rate in 2021 was 22 percent, representing what Alphabet was willing to pay for the data ‚Äî meaning that this data‚Äôs value for Alphabet was actually more like $66.46 in 2021 per person, and its total value was $81.26 per person (that is, $14.62 + $66.46). If we then extrapolate to the population of Canada (41.6 million), the total value of Canada‚Äôs data extracted by Alphabet was around $3.4 billion in 2021.

That means Alphabet alone is extracting US$3.4 billions‚Äô worth of data from Canadians every year, a pretty hefty amount that is missing from trade statistics.‚Äù",Tech

2025-04-22 21:53:40+00:00,"Global systems are not breaking. They are being rebuilt. The expansion of BRICS, the rise of local-currency trade, and the retreat from dollar-based institutions are not ideological. They are architectural. Nations want control over the systems that govern trade, capital flows, and decision-making.

This is where IonQ fits.

Quantum is not just better compute. It is a chance to redefine how decisions are made under uncertainty, especially in environments with competing interests. That includes markets, supply chains, and defense scenarios.

IonQ's game theory experiments with Prisoner's Dilemma and Chicken were not academic. They were early signals that quantum systems can do more than process faster. They can change the strategic logic of the systems they run.

Pair that with the macro picture. The dollar is losing utility as a tool of influence. Sanctions are pushing countries away. Tariffs are reshaping incentives. The logical next move for both nations and corporations is to find decision infrastructure they can control. Compute that is not tied to legacy cloud. Models that are not trapped in classical limits. Systems that are transparent, secure, and exportable.

That is IonQ's lane.

The company is not just ahead on hardware. It is ahead on framing. Commercial first. Protected IP at the game theory layer. And a roadmap that does not just scale trapped-ion systems. It scales quantum logic into new institutions.

The last era was defined by who controlled capital. The next will be defined by who controls compute and how decisions get made inside it.

IonQ is not chasing the last cycle. It is building the one that comes next.",Tech

They‚Äôre real‚Äîbut they‚Äôre also bait.

It‚Äôs like slow-cooking a frog.
Here‚Äôs what they‚Äôre not telling you‚Ä¶

TRANSPORTATION (Part 4)
Is It In Trump‚Äôs Wheelhouse?
By Will Cook | A Driver‚Äôs Perspective

[The Distraction Playbook]

Border chaos. Trans debates. Racial tension. Tariff Wars. 
They‚Äôre real‚Äîbut they‚Äôre also bait.
The elites weaponize these fights to keep truckers distracted on X while they reshape the economy without us. Every viral headline about migrants or pronouns is one less about the driverless trucks and visas drivers silently replacing our jobs little by little. It‚Äôs like slow cooking a live frog in boiling water. 

In April 2025,  Head of Department of Transportation Shawn Duffy stood on a podium calling for a National Safety Day focused on construction zones. Meanwhile, how many lives were lost this past year because of untrained, non‚ÄìEnglish speaking truck drivers operating on visa programs? God forbid we ask the real questions‚Äîlike how many of the semi-truck accidents in construction zones involved drivers who couldn‚Äôt speak English or had less than a year of experience behind the wheel.

Let‚Äôs be honest: there‚Äôs been more devastation caused by broken immigration loopholes and industry flooding than orange barrels. But talking about that? That‚Äôs off limits.
That‚Äôs ‚Äúnot inclusive.‚Äù

While Duffy and DOT put on press events, Kodiak Robotics quietly expands its Dallas hub to prep AI for cross-border freight by 2026. ( that will effect thousands of American and Mexico workers ) In March, Plus signed new deals to automate Arizona deliveries, cutting driver hours. You hear about that on the news? Of course not. Because border rants drown it out.

Culture wars are just as bad. X influencers push fights over gender, race, and flags. But while we‚Äôre split over social issues, Aurora‚Äôs driverless rigs are gliding down I-40, fully backed by FMCSA‚Äôs new ‚Äúsafety framework‚Äù for autonomous trucks. Nobody‚Äôs talking about the 200,000 driver jobs at risk by 2030‚Äîa stat buried in a February 2025 Trucking Alliance report. ( 200,000 thousand- those aren‚Äôt my made up numbers- those are from paid study reports ) Instead, what gets the headlines, arguing over school bathrooms.
Common sense issues we shouldn‚Äôt even have to be talking about. 
It‚Äôs a playbook:
Inflame. Divide. Conquer. And I‚Äôll spell it out clearly in Part 6- 

Congress will debate DEI programs or border bills all day‚Äîbut not a single hour is spent protecting working-class jobs from automation.
As ATA‚Äôs Andrew Boyle bluntly said back in March:

‚ÄúSocial chaos buries the economic threat to truckers.‚Äù

He‚Äôs right. We feel it.

The culture war doesn‚Äôt pay our bills stop robots or visa drivers. 
It‚Äôs the distraction that keeps us blind‚Ä¶ while both parties and their donors build a future where American drivers, warehouse and factory workers don‚Äôt exist.

Follow along to Part-10 
Specially tomorrow nights *Part-6* 
Be Blessed and Live Purposefully.

Before Eddie AI:
1. users transcribe interviews, such as in Adobe Premiere Pro
2. paste transcripts into ChatGPT and Claude
3. ask these AI models to find soundbites, pull out themes and topics, and create short scripts for a video
4. try to re-create the suggested edits back in Adobe/Blackmagic Design's DaVinci Resolve/Apple's FCP by scrubbing and finding in and out point and create the timeline + hoping it all sounded and looked right

Now:
1. import videos into Eddie and ask it to find soundbites, pull out themes and topics, and create edits
2. export it to Adobe/Resolve/FCP where the timeline seamlessly re-creates

Less steps and way, way faster.

-The US has preliminarily made a tariff deal with India in some form which involves the removal of specific tariffs which will enable ease of manufacturing and exports from India to the US
‚Äî> increased margins for similar / same output of product from skilled, cheap labor out of India

China is removing certain tariffs for a reason. Either a sign of some weakness, or a concession signal of a deal to come.

Currently, Apple produces about 20% of its global iPhones in India and has already exported $18 billion worth last year. The move was boosted by India‚Äôs Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, which offers subsidies to manufacturers.

Apple‚Äôs main partners in India ‚Äî Foxconn, Tata Electronics, and Pegatron ‚Äî have been major beneficiaries of these subsidies. Although Apple is slowly increasing its number of suppliers in India, China remains a major supplier base for now.

2025-04-28 23:29:21+00:00,"Xi Jinping Doesn‚Äôt Flinch at Trump‚ÄîWhy? Seoul Economic [Kang Haeryeong‚Äôs High-Tech]

Hello, readers with a keen interest in the information technology (IT) market. The keyword for this first half of the year is undoubtedly ‚Äútariffs.‚Äù You must be having a real headache over the trade risks unleashed by Trump‚Äôs administration.

Donald Trump‚Äôs ultimate target is Xi Jinping, the head of the ‚ÄúG2.‚Äù Starting his new term, Trump seems determined to slap tariffs on every product bearing the ‚ÄúMade in China‚Äù label. The White House even announced that cumulative tariff rates on certain Chinese exports have reached as high as 245%, unleashing a merciless tariff barrage.

But there‚Äôs a clear difference from Trump‚Äôs first term five years ago: China no longer cringes before the United States.

This phenomenon is even more evident in the semiconductor sector. As U.S.-origin semiconductor risks grew, China retaliated with its own semiconductor tariffs‚Äîan eye-for-an-eye approach. It hiked tariffs on certain U.S. semiconductor products from 84% to 125%, shaking U.S. industry to its core before eventually lifting them. (Memory semiconductors, however, still face retaliatory tariffs.)

Many people are surprised by how events have unfolded. Perhaps the most surprised of all is President Trump himself. Five years ago, China trembled at a single word from him‚Äîso why does it no longer waver in the face of a major punch?

From here, let‚Äôs examine China‚Äôs semiconductor industry situation to see what weapons Xi Jinping holds, and then summarize the message China is sending to Korea‚Äôs semiconductor ecosystem.

‚ÄúTrump, It Might Be Time to Show Your Mettle Even in Materials, Parts, and Equipment‚Äù in Xi Jinping‚Äôs Mind

First, let‚Äôs take stock of China‚Äôs overall semiconductor ecosystem. Consider Morgan Stanley‚Äôs chart on China‚Äôs semiconductor self-sufficiency rate. Comparing late 2020‚Äîat the end of Trump‚Äôs first term‚Äîwith 2025 is fascinating. China‚Äôs pace of semiconductor localization has been nothing short of transformative.

In particular, the equipment sector stands out. In 2020, domestic equipment accounted for only 5% of local use; in just five years, that rate has jumped 16 percentage points to 21%.

This rise is attributed not only to China‚Äôs top equipment maker, Naura, but also to firms like AMEC aggressively localizing equipment. I‚Äôll delve more into Naura later.

China is charging full steam ahead to establish semiconductor equipment technology. A notable insight from recent reporting: if you strip away the casing of U.S.-made equipment on a Chinese production line, you‚Äôll find that almost all the components inside are Chinese-made.

Two messages emerge from this. First, China is focusing more on ‚Äúacquiring technology‚Äù (to put it positively) than on whether it infringes on U.S. equipment suppliers‚Äô IP. Second, local component manufacturing has matured enough to actually run the equipment.

Here‚Äôs another insider tidbit: reports indicate that China has begun to stop importing U.S. semiconductor equipment. Multiple indications pointed to this, and U.S. export statistics confirm it: from around Q4 last year through February this year, exports of semiconductor equipment to China plummeted. Whether this reflects China‚Äôs rapid localization or is part of a broader strategy to check the U.S. remains to be seen, but it‚Äôs certainly intriguing data.

Growth in EDA tools‚Äîessential for semiconductor design‚Äîis likewise remarkable, up ten percentage points in five years. When we think of EDA tools, we picture U.S. brands like Cadence, Synopsys, and Siemens. Yet industry consensus now holds that Chinese EDA tools are ‚Äúquite usable‚Äù: Primarius, Xpeedic, and Empyrean are frequently mentioned. One industry insider noted, ‚ÄúPrimarius even pitches to Korean semiconductor design firms, and while it can‚Äôt match U.S. companies, it‚Äôs evaluated as ‚Äòquite serviceable.‚Äô‚Äù

And the share of memory supply‚Äîespecially NAND flash‚Äîhas surged. Its ratio has risen by 23 percentage points in five years, thanks to YMTC‚Äôs growth. Industry voices warn that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix should be more concerned about YMTC‚Äôs rising profile in NAND than about DRAM. As high-capacity servers increasingly use YMTC chips, Samsung and SK Hynix‚Äôs foothold in China is narrowing.

This explains why memory semiconductors aren‚Äôt included among China‚Äôs tariff-relief targets. Local players like YMTC are flooding the domestic market, and Samsung and SK Hynix maintain factories in Wuxi and Xi‚Äôan. In short, China‚Äôs calculation seems to be: ‚ÄúWe can handle memory even without U.S. Micron.‚Äù

According to Morgan Stanley‚Äôs analysis, China‚Äôs CPU self-sufficiency remains below 10%, and its GPU self-sufficiency‚Äîcrucial for AI chips‚Äîis at 0%. Just as Trump regulated exports of Nvidia‚Äôs H20, future measures will likely tighten AI chip and HBM memory transactions, targeting China‚Äôs Achilles‚Äô heel. Whether Chinese firms can localize these critical components under U.S. pressure will determine the next phase of the battle.

While China Has Been Growing‚Ä¶ What Has Korea Been Doing?

The core message of this article is simple: Xi Jinping isn‚Äôt intimidated by Trump because China has built confidence and conviction through solid inputs, making the outputs feel within reach. This line of thought carries a strong message for Korea‚Äôs semiconductor ecosystem.

Let‚Äôs shift the lens to Korea. On the surface, K-semiconductors are in a dominant position. Samsung still reigns supreme in production capacity, and SK Hynix posted record quarterly earnings in Q4 last year thanks to HBM, looking to have weathered tariff risks admirably. Yet drop just one tier below Samsung and SK Hynix, and it becomes clear that Korea is neither on par with nor even a match for China.

Recall Naura: China‚Äôs No. 1 equipment maker. You might dismiss it as a peripheral player from a technologically backward country. But compare it to Korea‚Äôs leading equipment firm, SEMES. Over the past five years, SEMES‚Äôs revenue has been stuck in the 2 trillion KRW range, with volatile operating profits. Naura, on the other hand, has been growing vigorously every year. Since 2022, its sales and operating profits began to outpace SEMES, and in 2023 and 2024 it widened the gap dramatically, earning a place among the global semiconductor equipment elite‚Äîlikely ranking sixth after Applied Materials, ASML, Tokyo Electron, Lam Research, and KLA.

This contrast epitomizes the mood in the materials-parts-equipment (MPE) sectors of Korea and China. From major chipmakers like YMTC, CXMT, and SMIC to the very foundations of semiconductor manufacturing, China has invested across the board‚Äîand when it invests aggressively, it quickly gains competitiveness.

By 2019, China was still a peripheral player in semiconductors; today, it can throw a jab at the U.S. thanks to its government‚Äôs exceptionally bold support. The third-phase semiconductor fund, launched in June last year, tops the combined value of Phase 1 (~20 trillion KRW) and Phase 2 (~40 trillion KRW) at 69 trillion KRW (¬•3440 billion). Unlike loans or tax credits, this fund delivers direct subsidies‚Äîreal firepower. China‚Äôs pursuit of EUV equipment development is not something to scoff at.

Korea has also seen calls to fix its distorted semiconductor ecosystem. During the 2019 Japan export restrictions crisis, ‚ÄúMPE self-reliance‚Äù was a rallying cry. Yet six years on, Korea‚Äôs MPE weakness remains unaddressed.

According to the government, Korea‚Äôs MPE import dependence has hovered around 70% for years. Seventy percent of equipment in Samsung and SK semiconductor fabs is foreign-made‚Äîa severe handicap in the global semiconductor arms race. The equipment sector has run a trade deficit since 2005‚Äî21 consecutive years. Silicon wafers, the bedrock of semiconductors, have run a trade deficit for about 50 years since 1970. Domestic player SK Siltron alone can‚Äôt compete with advanced firms like Shin-Etsu and SUMCO.

This month, the Korean government announced it would increase planned fiscal investment in semiconductors from 26 trillion KRW through 2027 to 33 trillion KRW, allocating 21.6 trillion KRW for MPE support. The plan includes supporting 30‚Äì50% of new investment costs for MPE firms, capped at 15 billion KRW per project and 20 billion KRW per company. Yet industry opinion deems this woefully insufficient given the technology gap with major foreign firms and the need for tailored corporate support.

What the government is ‚Äúscraping together‚Äù now feels like temporary pandemic relief funds rather than the direct subsidies China provides. To inject real cash into companies‚Äô pockets, Korea needs a ‚ÄúSemiconductor Special Act‚Äù‚Äîbut its passage remains murky.

In December of the year before last, the government held an ‚ÄúIndustrial Supply Chain Strategy Meeting‚Äù and set a goal to reduce import dependence on key items from 70% to below 50% by 2030. A ‚ÄúSupply Chain Stabilization Program‚Äù was slated for announcement in June, but with domestic political turbulence and an unexpected presidential election season, there are fears it may fizzle out.

On April 27, Lee Jae-myung, the Democratic Party‚Äôs presidential candidate, visited SK Hynix in Icheon for a ‚ÄúK-Semiconductor‚Äù roundtable with industry leaders. While admiring top-tier technologies like HBM and state-of-the-art fabs is certainly a source of pride, it would have been valuable had he also considered the origin ratios of equipment inside those fabs and reflected on Korea‚Äôs stagnant MPE competitiveness versus China‚Äôs aggressively growing model.

President Trump is raising tariffs to bring back American manufacturing jobs.  I applaud his courage.

BUT WHAT ABOUT Artificial Intelligence?

For over 25-years I have been saying the worst financial advice Is:

‚ÄúGo to school.  Get a job. Work hard. Pay taxes. Save money.  Get out of debt.  Your house is not an asset.  And invest for the long-term in the stock market.‚Äù

This old financial advice did not protect the millions of factory workers when their jobs began being exported to China, on December 11, 2001, when they were admitted into the World Trade Organization.

Who is next?

In 2025 AI (Artificial Intelligence) is beginning to take the jobs of educated professionals such as doctors, lawyers, engineers‚Ä¶etc. etc. etc.

What do these highly educated professionals, many with student loan debt, do when technology (AI) takes their jobs?

That is why for over 25-years‚Ä¶starting in 1996 with my Cashflow Boardgame, 1997 Rich Dad Poor Dad, and my other books‚Ä¶I have asked the simple question:

‚ÄúWhat did school teach you about money?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

AND:

‚ÄúWhat are you going to do  if you lose your job‚Ä¶.about your financial education?‚Äù

‚ÄúGo back to school?‚Äù

Please take care.  The world is changing.  

Please change with it.

Tariffs won‚Äôt protect you.
 
Tariffs only increase inflation‚Ä¶. as jobs are lost‚Ä¶.and wages come down.

Please increase your financial education and get richer‚Ä¶.as the world changes.

Joe Lonsdale @JTLonsdale, Co-founder of Palantir. Direct connections to Peter Thiel and Paypal 'Mafia' from his tenure at Paypal and Clarium Capital

David Sacks, the White House AI and crypto czar. His angel investments include Facebook, Uber, SpaceX, Palantir Technologies and PayPal Mafia with connections to Peter Thiel

Clark Minor, a 13-year Palantir veteran, is now RFK Jr.‚Äôs Health & Human Services Chief Information Officer.

Gregory Barbaccia, Palantir's former Head of Intelligence and Investigations, was hired as Federal Chief Information Officer

Jacob Helberg, a senior advisor to Palantir, was appointed as the Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment

Shyam Sankar @ssankar, Palantir‚Äôs Chief Technology Officer is reportedly being considered, for a high-level Pentagon job guiding research and development

Anthony Jancso, George Cooper and one other engineers have been associated with DOGE recruitment effort and they are former Palantir Forward Deployed Engineers

Peter Thiel @peterthiel, Palantir & PayPal co-founder, has been a mentor and major financial supporter of J.D Vance. Their relationship began around 2011 when Vance attended a talk by Thiel at Yale Law School, which inspired Vance to pivot his career away from law. Vance joined Thiel's global investment firm in 2017 and later worked at Thiel's venture capital firm, Mithril Capital. Thiel played a crucial role in Vance's political rise by donating $15 million to Vance's 2022 Senate campaign. This financial support helped Vance secure his victory. Thiel introduced Vance to former President Donald Trump, leading to Trump's endorsement of Vance for the Senate

‚ÄúFor Peter,‚Äù said one of the people familiar with his thinking, ‚ÄúVance is a generational bet.‚Äù

--Revolving Doors

Greg Little, one of the first Pentagon officials to run CDAO, joined Palantir as a senior counselor in August 2023.

David Spirk, who served as chief data officer at the Pentagon and contributed to the creation of CDAO, joined Palantir as senior counselor in July 2022.

Maura Thompson, who held various logistics positions at CDAO and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is now a deployment strategist at Palantir.

Trevor Austin, who worked as a Palantir engineer early in his career, is now CDAO‚Äôs acting chief technology officer.

Will Thibeau, who worked as deployment strategist at Palantir, later did a stint at CDAO as a policy analyst.

Joseph Larson, who headed AI policy and strategy at Palantir, went on to serve as a deputy chief at CDAO.

Matthew Turpin, an advisor to Palantir, served as the director of China for the National Security Council in the first Trump White House and as senior China advisor to Trump‚Äôs then-commerce secretary

Wendy Anderson, an executive with Pentagon experience who joined the company in 2020, holds the title of senior vice president of federal and national security.

Alexander Alden, a veteran of the first Trump administration who joined Palantir in 2021. Described as a ‚ÄúTrump loyalist,‚Äù Alden served as a special assistant at the Pentagon from 2017 to 2018 before becoming senior director on Trump‚Äôs National Security Council, responsible for emerging technologies and defense policy.

Jamie Fly, a former aide to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Trump‚Äôs newly installed secretary of state. Fly served as a foreign and national security affairs advisor to Rubio from 2013 to 2017 and did an earlier stint in the George W. Bush administration at both the Pentagon and National Security Council. He joined Palantir in August 2023. 

Geof Kahn, a Central Intelligence Agency veteran who worked on the transition team for the first Trump administration, assisting then-Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) during his confirmation process to be CIA director. Kahn later served as senior adviser to Pompeo and the CIA‚Äôs chief operating officer. He previously spent five years as policy director for the House Intelligence Committee from 2011 to 2017. Kahn joined Palantir in January 2023.

2025-05-07 23:15:00+00:00,"The Trump administration plans to rescind Biden-era AI chip curbs as part of a broader effort to revise semiconductor trade restrictions that have drawn strong opposition from major tech companies and foreign governments.

The repeal, which is not yet final, seeks to refashion a policy launched under President Joe Biden that created three broad tiers of countries for regulating the export of chips from Nvidia Corp. and others. The Trump administration will not enforce the so-called AI diffusion rule when it takes effect on May 15.

The changes are taking shape as President Donald Trump prepares for a trip to the Middle East, where a number of countries including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have bristled at restrictions on their ability to acquire AI chips.

The government‚Äôs decision could be announced as soon as Thursday.

Unveiled during Biden‚Äôs last week in office, the diffusion rule established new US licensing obligations for AI chip shipments to much of the world, as a final salvo after years of escalating restrictions on semiconductor trade. The measure sought to prevent China from acquiring AI chip technology via intermediaries and to bring more nations into the US orbit by setting security requirements to access best-in-class American technology.

‚ÄúThe Biden AI rule is overly complex, overly bureaucratic, and would stymie American innovation,‚Äù the Commerce Department‚Äôs Bureau of Industry and Security said in a statement released by a spokesperson. ‚ÄúWe will be replacing it with a much simpler rule that unleashes American innovation and ensures American AI dominance.‚Äù

This is a formal update regarding our @Bitsgap AI Trade Bot, which is designed to generate revenue for our $LEGAL ü™ô token holders. 

‚úÖ We are currently awaiting the complete clearance of funding from @cryptocom; however, we have initiated our AI bot with an initial investment of $1000. 

üî∂ Our goal is to fully fund the account with $6500 to operate two distinct trade bots. Presently, the bot has been active for four days and 19 hours, successfully executing 370 trades that have yielded $28.64 in realized gains, equating to a 3.02% return on the initial investment. 

‚úÖ At its current rate, the bot is achieving an average daily return of 0.62%. If this trend persists with the new bot once it becomes operational, we could anticipate profits nearing 15%. 

üî∂ This figure aligns with the upper limit of our monthly expectations, indicating that maintaining a 15% monthly return on our bots could significantly enhance our revenue generation.

It is crucial for everyone to observe the trading patterns.

üî∂ Notably, the bot is selling during price increases and purchasing during declines, which contrasts with conventional trading strategies. (Most traders buy on Green and sell on Red). 

Currently, this AI trade bot is configured to trade @litecoin #TAO & #TRUMP. 

Upon the clearance of full funding, we will operate two bots: one AI bot and one #XRP grid bot. 

‚úÖ We will conduct tests for an additional month to evaluate our returns, after which we will establish our affiliate program, enabling our holders to create their own accounts at no cost, without token restrictions. This initiative is integral to our revenue generation strategy. 

We encourage participation in these trading activities and will share updates on our progress as we continue to refine our approach. ü™ôü™ôü™ôü™ôü™ô",Tech

2025-05-08 19:37:05+00:00,"Nvidia AI Chip Shipments to Malaysia Break New Record: Nearly $3 Billion Worth of GPUs in April

Last month, I shared how‚Äîdespite U.S. warnings to Malaysia and requests to monitor chip imports and smuggling‚Äîthe country has been breaking records like never before. Nearly $2 billion worth of chips were imported into Malaysia in March alone, raising eyebrows across the industry. But that now seems like just a teaser compared to April‚Äôs numbers.

According to official data from the Taiwan government, Malaysia imported nearly $3 billion worth of GPUs in April alone, setting yet another record‚Äîbeating March‚Äîand continuing a trend of triple-digit monthly increases since January 2025.

Let‚Äôs talk numbers:

* 2022: $817 million
* 2023: $1.276 billion
* 2024: $4.877 billion ‚Äî a nearly 300% YoY increase

2025:
* January: $1.12 billion (!) ‚Äî nearly 700% YoY increase
* February: $626.5 million
* March: $1.96 billion (!) ‚Äî an astonishing 3,400% increase from 2023
* April: $2.74 billion (!) ‚Äî another 3,400% increase from 2023

Malaysia has now imported $6.45 billion worth of GPUs year-to-date (!)

Now let‚Äôs look at how massive this is compared to Nvidia‚Äôs expected revenue in Q1 ‚Äî and why chip smuggling and AI-related policies or restrictions might be fiercely opposed by Nvidia and its lobbyists, even if it goes against U.S. interests.

Nvidia‚Äôs Q1 covers February to April. During this period, Malaysia alone imported $5.33 billion worth of GPUs. Nvidia‚Äôs estimated Q1 revenue is $43 billion ‚Äî meaning that Malaysia accounts for around 13% (!!) of Nvidia‚Äôs total revenue in this quarter.

According to SEC rules, if more than 10% of the total revenue comes from one country, it‚Äôs considered significant and must be disclosed in the company‚Äôs 10-Q filing.

Will it be?
Don‚Äôt hold your breath.

as I reported back in February, Nvidia invented a new reporting method called ""Geographic Revenue Based Upon Customer Billing Location."" Under this method, they‚Äôre only required to report the billing location, not the shipping location. So, they don‚Äôt have to mention Malaysia ‚Äî even if billions worth of GPUs are being shipped there.

Will the BIS take a second look at Malaysia?
Will the SEC start questioning Nvidia‚Äôs creative reporting methods?

I still have hope.",Tech

This ZERO-DEBT adtech beast has $1.9B cash and quietly grew from $114M to $2.45B revenue in 10 years. 

While debt-laden tech crumbles, The Trade Desk is crushing it! Here's why smart money is piling in üßµ

üßµ 7 Reasons The Trade Desk ($TTD) Could Be Your Next Multi-Bagger

1Ô∏è‚É£ They're Eating Google's Lunch

$TTD just posted $616M revenue (+25% YoY)‚Äîcrushing estimates during an ""ad recession."" 

Their secret? The Kokai platform slashes advertiser costs by 24% per conversion while $GOOG $GOOGL / $META keep raising prices. 

This explains their unheard-of 95% client retention for 11 straight years.

2Ô∏è‚É£ The Netflix Effect

Remember when Netflix $NFLX said ""never ads""? 

Now The Trade Desk powers those ads. As streaming giants (Netflix, Disney+, Max) embrace ad tiers, $TTD is the backend making it all work. 

Connected TV revenue is exploding as $480B in TV ad budgets shift to streaming‚Äîand $TTD gets a cut of every dollar.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Cookie Apocalypse Winner

While adtech competitors panic about Google killing cookies, $TTD has already built the solution: Unified ID 2.0. Major publishers, advertisers, and platforms are adopting it as the new standard. 

This isn't just surviving change‚Äîit's capitalizing on industry disruption.

4Ô∏è‚É£ International Hypergrowth

Most US tech struggles overseas, but TTD's international growth is now outpacing North America. 

They're expanding into a $1 TRILLION global ad market while competitors focus only on saturated markets. 

Asia alone represents a 10X opportunity.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Financial Fortress

üíö Zero debt. $1.9B cash.ü•≥

34% EBITDA margins. $386M in share buybacks. 

In this economic climate, this balance sheet is rare‚Äîespecially for a high-growth tech company. 

They can acquire competitors, invest through downturns, and compound returns while debt-laden rivals struggle.

6Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Driven Competitive Moat

The Sincera acquisition gives TTD unmatched ad data insights. 

Their AI can now predict which ads will convert before they run, creating a flywheel effect: better results ‚Üí more ad spend ‚Üí more data ‚Üí even better results. 

This explains why their revenue growth is accelerating, not slowing.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Market Misunderstanding

Wall Street still categorizes TTD as ""just another adtech company"" (hence the recent selloff), completely missing that they're building the infrastructure for all digital advertising. 

Think $AMZN AWS for ads‚Äîa platform play, not an ad network.

At $70.65, $TTD trades at 44x earnings‚Äîa premium, but justified for a company growing revenues 25% with no debt and 34% EBITDA margins. Analysts see 22% upside to $86.49, but that's likely conservative given their consistent beats.

In a market where SaaS valuations collapsed, which do you think has more 5-year potential: $TTD in adtech, $SNOW in data cloud, or $DDOG in monitoring?

2025-05-10 17:35:17+00:00,"Imagine a place where AI agents are not just tools-but assets you can own, trade, and earn from. 
Allow me welcome you to @virtuals_io , a new kind of platform where blockchain meets artificial intelligence. It‚Äôs more than just tech buzzwords-it‚Äôs a real chance to earn by contributing, learning, and exploring. Let‚Äôs break it all down.

What is Virtuals Protocol, Really?

At the heart of Virtuals Protocol is a bold idea: let people create, own, and even make money from AI agents.  These agents can do tasks, generate income, and be bought or sold like digital collectibles.

The platform has its own token called $VIRTUAL-used for staking, voting, and, most excitingly, joining early-stage token launches.

How do you Earn Points on Virtuals

To keep users active and involved, Virtuals has something called Virgen Points‚Äîand you can earn them in two main ways:

1. Trading Tokens

If you like the thrill of buying and selling, this is for you. The more you trade AI tokens on the platform, the more points you earn. Plus, it helps boost activity in the ecosystem.

2. Yapping (Yes, Talking!)

Yapping is their fun way of saying creating content. Whether it‚Äôs writing threads on X (Twitter), doing deep dives, or publishing quick takes‚Äîyour content matters. Once submitted, Virtuals reviews it, and if it‚Äôs good (and gets engagement), you‚Äôll be rewarded with points.

What Can You Do with These Points?
Here‚Äôs where it gets exciting.
Join Presales: You can use your points to buy tokens from new projects launching on Virtuals before the general public. Think of it as getting in early, just like private investors.

Cash Out: Not interested in holding? No problem. You can convert your points directly to stablecoins and take your profits.

Someone recently swapped 41,000 points for about $800. That‚Äôs a decent return just for showing up, trading, or creating content.

The Genesis Launchpad makes room for Fairer System

This isn‚Äôt your typical launchpad that only favors big investors. Virtuals built something called the Genesis Launchpad‚Äîand it runs on proof of contribution.

That means your work, engagement, and effort count just as much (if not more) than how much money you bring. Whether you‚Äôre a content creator, trader, or researcher, you have a fair shot at being rewarded.

TL;DR
Virtuals Protocol is building something special-an ecosystem where AI agents meet Web3, and where you can earn by being active and curious. Whether you‚Äôre trading tokens, writing threads, or just keeping up with new projects, there‚Äôs room for everyone to benefit.
It‚Äôs still early, and like all things in crypto, it‚Äôs evolving. But one thing is clear: the more you explore and engage, the more rewards you can unlock.

If you‚Äôre ready to be part of the future of AI and Web3-Virtuals might just be the playground you‚Äôve been looking for.",Tech

Centralized AI is powerful, but fragile, controlled by a handful of corporations, closed-source, and vulnerable to bias, censorship, and single points of failure. Decentralized AI flips that model: open, trustless, and community-driven.

Cortensor is building that future.
A verifiable, decentralized AI network powered by Proof-of-Inference and open infrastructure, built for scale, transparency, and real-world use.

Why Cortensor will run:
‚Ä¢354 active nodes already running, showing strong early adoption
‚Ä¢46.76% of supply staked, deep commitment from holders
‚Ä¢29.78 ETH in buybacks, team is putting real capital behind the ecosystem
‚Ä¢Mainnet coming in 2026, early builders have a window to get in now

Developer doxxing is a positive signal.
With a founder who:
‚Ä¢Scaled Google Cloud, Chrome, and Android
‚Ä¢Sold a DePIN startup to a fintech unicorn
‚Ä¢Built infrastructure used by 100M+ users

There are no red flags, only real credentials and real experience. In a space plagued by vaporware and anonymity, doxxing builds trust and signals long-term skin in the game.

Fundamentally, decentralized AI is about freedom, security, and transparency. Cortensor is building the rails, not just for users, but for devs, researchers, and the entire next-gen AI economy.

If you missed OpenAI, don‚Äôt miss this.

I still have some questions about its model and how it handles assets and depreciation over the long run, but the incredible demand it is seeing should buoy the stock and the company in the near term giving it more runway to win business, raise needed capital, and win over investors.

 Dow up 141 pts | Nasdaq dips | Nvidia, Tesla surge double digits

Wall Street continued its rebound Thursday as the S&P 500 climbed for a fourth consecutive session, supported by easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and cooling inflation data.

S&P 500: +0.3%

Dow Jones: +141 points (+0.3%)

Nasdaq Composite: -0.3%

üíπ What‚Äôs Driving the Rally?

Investor sentiment remains buoyed by last weekend‚Äôs breakthrough trade talks, where Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese officials agreed to a 90-day tariff suspension‚Äîhelping douse fears of an imminent recession or supply-chain-driven inflation spike.

The Producer Price Index (PPI) for April declined 0.5% MoM, sharply defying expectations of a 0.3% increase. Retail sales met expectations with a modest 0.1% rise, while industrial production slipped slightly more than forecast.

üìÖ What‚Äôs Next?
Markets will now watch whether the equity rally can broaden and hold through summer. With macro data flashing mixed signals and valuations stretched in some tech names, analysts warn that a healthy pullback or sector rotation could emerge unless economic growth reaccelerates.

The XRP bot, in the same time frame, has posted a 0.92% gain, averaging 0.21% per day ‚Äî which could lead to an estimated 6.3% return over 30 days.

‚òëÔ∏è Once our testing is done, then we should be going live and profits generated will finally be put back into our charts.  

For those who need any direct help, you may reach out to @ShowMYourCrypto he runs our bots for us and helps maintain their grids. 

You may visit our Discord Channel for more detailed information.

2025-05-19 23:10:55+00:00,"my best advice to anyone using ai tools is don't use openai for anything - they can't be trusted with your data and you dont know the value trade you're committing rn by using their products and giving them all your data - they want to scan your eyes - they want to kyc verify you - they want access to your terminal - they want access to your repos - literally consider the magnitude of privacy you're giving up for convenience when they don't even have the best models anymore

use claude sonnet 3.7 or gemini 2.5 pro in cursor privacy mode for coding or use local models and run eigencode for full local privacy - gemma3 and deepseek and qwen3 are decent

for chat and search your best bet is probably gonna be using grok, although it's still a bit retarded the connection to X and all their resources and everything should entrench grok as a winner in search and general chat ai eventually - hopefully grok 3.5 will already start cementing it",Tech

tao just posted a 188% 24h volume spike (21.8 eth), but the floor collapsed 77% to 0.09 eth‚Äîwhile top bid sits 5x above floor at 0.498. avg sale price cratered nearly 25% overnight, even as trade count surged 283% to 23. this isn‚Äôt forced selling on illiquidity: two of three tokens are listed, and the collection only has 3 tokens and 178 owners, so every sale materially moves the market. volume-to-market-cap is off the charts (>5.8x in 24h), which is unsustainable and signals churn, not new conviction.

compare to high-velocity small supply plays like treeNFT (1 token listed, 40 eth volume on the day, but floor holding at 99 eth), tao‚Äôs supply is hyper-fragmented‚Äîno anchor holders, no sticky floor. the listings are thin, but instead of price discovery pushing up, the market is gapping down. wallet distribution is extreme: 178 owners for 3 tokens, so either rampant fractionalization or misidentified contract, but the data‚Äôs clear‚Äîbid/ask spread is wider than any top 50 collection, and price action is pure volatility.

net: this is not a rotation into tao, it‚Äôs an exit. volume is from capitulation, not accumulation. the disconnect between bid depth and floor price, with avg sale price whipsawing, means any entry here is a bet on volatility, not value. unless you have edge on the underlying mechanism, this is pure order flow roulette‚Äîdon‚Äôt mistake activity for demand.",Tech

After extensive R&D and multiple prototypes, v1 and v2 didn‚Äôt meet our standards.
Now, with v3, we‚Äôre closer than ever to the perfect fusion of:
‚Ä¢Classic hardware engineering
‚Ä¢Web3 authentication
‚Ä¢True privacy-first design

What‚Äôs Next?

Today, their revealing the first teaser: E-ink screen testing for LGT v3.
This marks the beginning of the LGT saga from concept to engineering, design, and a working prototype.

Pre-Orders Coming Soon

The world‚Äôs first hardware vault built at the intersection of Web3 and privacy is almost here.
Pre-orders open in the coming weeks.

2025-05-24 19:46:42+00:00,"Web3 has spent years theorizing about verifiable compute. But projects like @MagicNewton X @SuccinctLabs are finally doing it.

Newton introduces a verifiable automation layer for onchain finance. Think AI agents that can trade, rebalance, arbitrate and automate DeFi actions across chains without asking you to trust a black box. Every action they take is provable.

And this is where succinct comes in.

Succinct is building a decentralized network of provers that generate and verify zero knowledge proofs for any arbitrary computation. These proofs make it possible to confirm that offchain logic like an AI agent‚Äôs decision or a crosschain strategy actually followed the user‚Äôs instructions, without having to rerun the logic yourself.

In Newton, every agent is deployed with strict, user defined rules called zkPermissions. They act like smart contracts for offchain automation encoded conditions that must be proven before the task is approved. Newton uses ZKPs to enforce that these AI agents never act beyond what users explicitly allow.

To make this scalable and cost effective, Newton taps into succinct‚Äôs prover infrastructure. Operators within newton‚Äôs automation marketplace can batch up tasks and generate succinct validity proofs ensuring that even complex, offchain workflows are verified and accountable.

In other words:
‚Ä¢ Newton doesn‚Äôt just trust that the AI did the right thing, it proves it, using succinct‚Äôs cryptographic backbone.

The beauty of this whole thing is that... it‚Äôs a live, testable infrastructure that turns web3 automation into something users can actually trust and developers can build on.

As more protocols look to integrate AI agents or automate execution across fragmented chains, newton is already showing how succinct‚Äôs tech can anchor it all in proof.",Tech

Additional factors include a weak 20-year Treasury bond auction, which saw yields hit a record 5.047%, signaling investor caution toward U.S. assets amid rising debt concerns.

2025-05-25 19:46:18+00:00,"Let‚Äôs break it down into detailed structural impacts of Trump‚Äôs 2025 tariff and industrial policy ‚Äî focusing on how it damages small, smart, high-tech, and green-forward businesses in the U.S.

1. Tariff Structure in 2025: Broad, Punitive, and Misaligned

Scope:

Tariffs remain or have been reintroduced on goods from over 180 countries, including key U.S. tech partners:

China: Electronics, machinery, rare earths, solar panels, AI components

EU: Robotics parts, biotech goods, automotive chips

Japan & South Korea: Semiconductors, battery tech, AI hardware

Canada: Raw materials, lithium, AI cloud infrastructure support

Result:

High-tech supply chains are interrupted or made more expensive, especially for:

AI startups

Robotics firms

EV and battery production

Cloud computing infrastructure (chips, boards, power systems)

3D-printed hardware and smart sensors

These tariff zones overlap with 90%+ of innovation trade corridors.

2. High-Tech Business Models Undermined

Small & Smart Businesses:

Margins are low, but speed and flexibility are high.

These companies depend on importing small-batch precision parts from multiple countries.

Tariffs increase import costs 15‚Äì40%, forcing firms to:

Raise prices (lose market share)

Relocate (expensive)

Scale down (reduce jobs)

High-Tech Startups:

Many use agile prototyping and offshore manufacturing to build MVPs (minimum viable products).

Tariffs make these MVPs unviable in U.S. market.

Capital funding dries up due to investor fear of unpredictability.

3. Fossil-Focused Industrial Policy Blocks Future Industries

Trump‚Äôs 2025 focus:

Oil, coal, steel, and combustion vehicles are heavily subsidized and politically spotlighted.

EVs and solar/battery tech face indirect punishment via:

Tariffs on lithium-ion battery cells

Restrictions on solar panel imports

Delays in green infrastructure permits

Blocking ‚ÄúDark Factories‚Äù & Automation:

U.S. has fallen behind China, Japan, Germany in:

Fully automated robotics factories (no lighting needed, run by AI)

AI-driven logistics and microfactory networks

Reason: Lack of federal support, high tariffs on needed machinery, and focus on human-heavy legacy manufacturing

4. Anti-Innovation Trade Focus

Wrong Geopolitical Priorities:

Trump tries to rekindle trade with Russia, even as U.S. allies apply sanctions.

Meanwhile, he antagonizes the most innovative economies in the world:

Canada: AI governance, green mining tech

EU: Clean energy integration, robotics

Japan: Humanoid robotics, precision engineering

China: High-volume AI chips, drone technology, solar scaling

Result:

The U.S. becomes more isolated in tech standard-setting, unable to shape:

Quantum-AI communication protocols

Robotic labor guidelines

Global data & smart device regulations

5. Macro Outcome in 2025

Green energy goals slip (behind EU, China, Canada)

U.S. robotics manufacturing lags by 3‚Äì5 years

Smart logistics (e.g., AI-directed delivery fleets, automated ports) are underdeveloped

Tech startups decline by 14% YoY

Venture capital moves offshore

Rural AI/robotic deployments stall, deepening regional divides",Tech

Okay. It‚Äôs an impressive, high-tech truck, but what exactly does it do, and what makes it so groundbreaking? üëá

TITAN is Army‚Äôs first AI-defined vehicle and stands for 
Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node, mobile ground station developed by Palantir Technologies for the U.S. Army. It integrates data from space, air, and terrestrial sensors to provide real-time, actionable intelligence for enhanced mission command and long-range precision strikes. The system uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to process vast amounts of data, reducing the time between data collection and precision targeting. Palantir, as the prime contractor, leads a team including Northrop Grumman, Anduril Industries, and L3Harris Technologies to deliver 10 prototypes under a $178.4 million contract awarded in March 2024. These prototypes include five advanced variants, integrated with tactical trucks like the M1083, and five basic variants, mounted on Joint Light Tactical Vehicles. TITAN supports the Army‚Äôs Multi-Domain Operations and Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) by fusing sensor data to improve battlefield decision-making.

Company expects to complete all 10 systems by 2026, after which the Army will decide whether to carry TITAN into full-rate production. Although the service hasn‚Äôt said how many systems it will buy, officials have estimated between 100 and 150 units.

TITAN offers a flexible and scalable ground station designed to modernize the Army with the latest deep sensing and sensor fusion capabilities.

Key Capabilities:

-Reducing sensor-to-shooter timelines
-Integrated with Army and Joint Fires systems
-Reducing Soldier workflow burdens and cognitive load
-Deeper sensing that can interoperate with modern sensors
-Accurate and effective targeting enabled by AI/ML
-Enabling collection and processing while on the move

The U.S. Army now has in hand a few Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Nodes, state-of-the-art trucks that promise to streamline the battlefield process of spotting, tracking and blasting.

Why it matters: The program ‚Äî years in the making, but also on time and budget ‚Äî is critical to the Defense Department's connect-everything-everywhere dream of Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control.

It also supports two of the Army's biggest ambitions: deep sensing and long-range precision fires, or the ability to find, shoot and kill more accurately from farther away.

Lord Ian Austin, the UK‚Äôs trade envoy to Israel, visited Haifa this week to check out high-tech projects and ports. 

But here‚Äôs the twist: The UK just paused new trade talks with Israel because of what‚Äôs happening in Gaza.

Austin‚Äôs trip has sparked some questions. 

He‚Äôs not meeting Israeli officials, only businesses. 

The UK government says this isn‚Äôt about new deals‚Äîit‚Äôs about keeping old ones going. 

Austin was picked as envoy in 2019 after he left the Labour Party over its handling of antisemitism.

Meanwhile, the UK‚Äôs foreign secretary, David Lammy, is blasting Israel‚Äôs Gaza campaign as ‚Äúmonstrous,‚Äù and says the country‚Äôs actions go against British values.

For now, Austin‚Äôs trip is about business ties, even as Britain takes a harder line on Israel‚Äôs politics. 

The embassy posted photos of his tour, but it‚Äôs unclear if Lammy gave the thumbs-up. 

Austin, for his part, isn‚Äôt saying much.

2025-05-27 22:11:26+00:00,"BREAKING: Donald Trump's White House adviser Kevin Hassett gets obliterated on live television by a conservative host as tariffs threaten to spike iPhone prices to $3,500.

The MAGA house of cards is collapsing...

""We're trying to figure out an off-ramp for Apple. It'd be a $3,000 iPhone if they tried to make everything here,"" said CNBC host Joe Kernan, addressing Trump's threat to slap a 25% tariff on Apple products. 

He was speaking to Kevin Hassett, Trump's clueless Director of the National Economic Council.

""$3,500,"" interjected co-host Andrew Ross Sorkin.

""$3,500 for a good one, the kind you'd like probably,"" agreed Kernan. ""What is Tim Cook supposed to do?""

""Right. Well, you know, we'll see how it works out,"" said Hassett. ""But the bottom line is that what we're trying to do is onshore as much as we can in the U.S. and make it so that the U.S. is not hyper-dependent on imports from China.""

""And so, uh, I think that one of the things we're seeing is that people are moving way faster than you might expect,"" he added. ""If you look at the 20% equipment investment in the first quarter before the tariffs even came in.""

""You know, with supply chains moving fast and just-in-time inventory management and AI, I think you're going to be astonished in how quickly stuff moves onshore,"" he went on. 

""And that's what we're shooting for and in the interim, you know, then we'll see how it works out,"" he added. ""But they need to move their stuff onshore as much as possible to make it so that the U.S. economy is secure and not prone to, you know, Chinese extortion.""

The irony, of course, is that this administration is trading alleged Chinese extortion for actual extortion from Donald Trump. These tariffs are designed to empower and enrich him personally, nothing more.

""But Kevin, I did some reporting actually on the Apple issue over the weekend, wrote something in DealBook this morning about it, which is what do you think about the prospect‚Äî"" began Andrew Ross Sorkin. 

""If Tim Cook were to come to you and say 'Look, we obviously can't move everything in twelve months. It's just not going to happen. Maybe we could start to move things over several years. In the meantime we could try to assemble more of the phone in the United States so you could actually write on the phone Assembled in the United States,'"" he continued. 

""Or potentially, depending on what you think the merits of it are: 'Made in the United States' maybe at their Texas facility or something else but with a longer term plan of maybe five or ten years frankly, of being able to actually manufacture the phones here,"" he went on.

""If he were to come to you with something like that, do you think that then there would be a reprieve for the next couple years as they get their house in order?"" asked Ross Sorkin. ""Because clearly it's almost, just from a physical standpoint, impossible to move everything over night. And the damage you could do to the company over night is obviously tremendous.""

""Well, well, it is impossible to move things over night but one of the things we're seeing ‚Äî I was joking with a person who does bond rating in the U.S. in my office a few weeks ago ‚Äî and, uh, one of the things that happens at the Director of National Economic Council's office is that CEOs line up in my office,"" said Hassett. 

""I'm kind of like the, um, the person on the airplane that's getting walloped over the head by everybody. Where everybody says 'Oh like we're never going to be able to do anything if we have this tariff, it's going to be a disaster if we have this tariff,'"" he continued. 

""And then my friend who's a bond rater said 'Actually they come in and they tell me the opposite because they don't want the bonds to be downgraded,"" claimed Hassett. ""And so the point is everybody is trying to make it seem like a catastrophe if there's a tiny little tariff on them right now to try to negotiate down the tariffs.""

""And so in the end we'll see what happens. We'll see what the end game is but we don't want to harm Apple,"" he went on. ""In the end, if you think that Apple has a factory some place, uh, that's got like a set number of iPhones that it produces and it needs to sell them no matter what, then Apple will bear those tariffs not consumers.""

As we all know by now ‚Äî and as Trump himself has tacit admitted by ordering Walmart to ""EAT THE TARIFFS"" ‚Äî tariffs are a tax on consumers. We pay the price for Trump's economically illiterate policies.

2025-05-27 22:12:09+00:00,"At first glance, $CFGI might look like just another ‚ÄúFear & Greed‚Äù indicator.

But under the hood, it‚Äôs a monster of AI trading data, automation, and compounding profit.

It‚Äôs the fuel AI needs to trade crypto. And no one else has it.

üßµ

They‚Äôve been quietly collecting proprietary trading data since 2022 ‚Äî multiple timeframes, thousands of algorithms, updated every 15 minutes.

This isn‚Äôt scraping public data. It‚Äôs built from their own infrastructure. 

And it powers something insane:
Meet M.A.E.V.E.
The plug & play AI trading bot that connects directly to your favorite exchange and trades for you.

Fully automated. No input. No bots to configure.
Just... compounding.

Since early access?
94.3% win rate over 500+ trades. 
 
Yep, that‚Äôs right. 94.3% win rate in 500+ public trades.

You ask me, how much money does MAEVE make? Something around 5% average portfolio growth PER MONTH right now, at early stages. Once low leverage is implemented (already being tested - with incredible results) a 10% montlhy average is very likely to happen.

How does MAEVE work?
MAEVE doesn‚Äôt look at price. She analyzes behavior.
Order books, volatility, dominance, sentiment, Google trends... all in real-time.

She knows when a market is pumping, dumping, or about to flip. And she adapts her strategy.

Smart money, literally. 

She buys low and sells higher. It's that simple.

But what really caught my attention?
They're still pre-growth. No full monetization yet.

Still expanding into NFTs, Stocks, Forex, Meme markets...

Still about to list on exchanges.

Still about to launch full public access to MAEVE.

All this, and already:
üìà 60,000+ users
 üìä18,000+ verified subs
 üîå50+ active API devs
 üíºTrusted by Forbes, Bybit, Bitget, MEXC, etc.
 üöÄHitting #1 on Google for nearly every altcoin searched.

And still flying under the radar...

Utilities of $CFGI are real:
‚Äì Early access to MAEVE (AI trading bot)
‚Äì API access
‚Äì Unlimited trading size (for whales)
‚Äì 50% of platform revenue used to buy back $CFGI daily
‚Äì Passive rewards airdropped to token holders

Yes, really.

They‚Äôre also launching NFTs soon.
 
Some NFTs unlock rare MAEVE versions:
- Higher leverage (Yes, leverage is coming)
- $1M+ portfolio trading
- Zero fee trading
And a lot more... Get excited!

About the team:
All team members are fully doxxed with
@AssureDefi. And these guys are probably the most commited and hardworking team I've seen in crypto.  They have absolutely delivered everything they've promised so far. 

They‚Äôre building the backend of the next wave of AI + crypto trading.
And they own the data.
 
So yeah. I bought a big bag of $CFGI. I believe in this team. 

Because they‚Äôre not building hype.
They‚Äôre building infrastructure that people will use and will make money off (lots of it).

If you read this far: YAGMI

NVIDIA shines, but macro headwinds keep the rally in check
Thursday, May 29, 2025

Hello traders and investors,

Today was supposed to be all about NVIDIA ($NVDA) after its knockout earnings and bullish guidance, but the market had other plans. A pair of legal rulings on the Trump administration‚Äôs tariff policy and a batch of weak economic data quickly stole the spotlight, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty that tempered enthusiasm across the board.

üîç Market Summary:
S&P 500: Held above the key 5,900 mark despite early weakness, closing modestly higher

Dow Jones: Dragged by Salesforce $CRM and other laggards

NASDAQ: Got a lift from NVIDIA, but broader growth concerns weighed

‚öñÔ∏è Tariffs Take Center Stage:
The U.S. Court of International Trade initially struck down the administration‚Äôs ability to enforce tariffs‚Äîbut the White House swiftly appealed and won a temporary reinstatement. So for now, the 10% global, 30% China, and 25% Canada/Mexico tariffs stay in place until at least June 9. The back-and-forth fueled market uncertainty, especially as the administration continues pitching tariffs as a tool to reduce the national debt.

üßÆ Economic Data Breakdown:
Initial Jobless Claims:
Rose to 240K (vs. 230K est.)
Continuing claims hit a post-2021 high at 1.919M
Signals a possible softening labor market

Q1 GDP (Second Estimate):
Revised to -0.2% (vs. -0.3% prior)
Personal spending dropped to +1.2% from +1.8%, suggesting consumer hesitation

Pending Home Sales (April):
Fell sharply -6.3% (vs. -1.1% est.)
A big reversal from March‚Äôs upwardly revised +5.5%
Another sign of cooling demand

üíµ Bonds, Dollar & Auctions:

10-Year Yield: Fell to 4.43%

30-Year Yield: Dropped to 4.93%

Dollar Index: Down 0.5% to 99.39, after being up 0.7% overnight

7-Year Treasury Auction: Strong demand helped ease long-end pressure

Despite the drop in yields, equities didn‚Äôt pop‚Äîgrowth fears, not optimism, were driving bonds.

üìä Sector Performance:

Winners:
Real Estate (+0.9%) led
Tech (+0.6%) supported by NVIDIA strength

Loser:
Communication Services (-0.3%) was the only red sector
Market Breadth:

NYSE advancers beat decliners more than 2-to-1

NASDAQ: Advancers outpaced decliners by nearly 13-to-9

üßæ Notable Movers:

$NVDA: +3.2% ‚Äî AI enthusiasm lifts the broader tech complex

$BBY: -7.3% ‚Äî Cut FY26 guidance
$CRM: -3.3% ‚Äî Cloud growth slows

üìÖ YTD Performance Check:
S&P 500: +0.5%

NASDAQ: -0.7%

DJIA: -0.8%

S&P 400 Mid Cap: -3.5%

Russell 2000: -7.0%

 Summary:
NVIDIA‚Äôs blowout results gave the market a shot of optimism, but the mood quickly shifted thanks to fresh tariff drama, softening job market signals, and consumer fatigue. Add in a sharp drop in home sales and it was clear‚Äîgrowth concerns aren‚Äôt going away. That said, broad participation and a decent close show there's still some underlying bid in this market, even if buyers are cautious.",Tech

Tariffs, Tech Sanctions & a Classic Afternoon Reversal
Friday, May 30, 2025 ‚Äî Market Close

Hello traders and investors,

The final trading day of May delivered a tale of two sessions. Early losses driven by trade tensions and tech-sector weakness gave way to a sharp afternoon rebound, salvaging what had been a red start to the day and wrapping up the month on a relatively high note.

Market Summary:
S&P 500: 5,843 (‚Äì1.2% intraday low, closed flat)

DJIA: Ended the session slightly green after a midday dip

NASDAQ: Trimmed early losses to close modestly lower

Market Breadth: Mixed ‚Äî consumer staples and utilities carried the load while tech and semis dragged.

What Moved the Market Today:
Trump‚Äôs Trade Rant: A social media post from President Trump accusing China of breaking the trade agreement ‚Äî capped off with ‚ÄúSo much for being Mr. NICE GUY!‚Äù ‚Äî sparked a defensive move early on.

Tech Sanctions Rumor: Bloomberg reported the U.S. may issue more China-related tech sanctions, intensifying the mid-session slide.

Rebound Fuel: The comeback started after Trump said he‚Äôs likely to speak with President Xi soon. That helped ease the trade nerves and prompted short-covering.

Economic Data: Inflation cooled in April and income growth stayed strong ‚Äî signs of a healthy consumer and solid footing for Q2 GDP.

Sector Highlights:
Winners:
Consumer Staples (+1.2%) ‚Äî Led by Costco ($COST +3.1%) after a strong earnings print
Utilities (+1.1%) ‚Äî Benefited from the defensive tone early on

Laggards:
Energy (‚Äì0.7%), Consumer Discretionary (‚Äì0.6%), and Tech (‚Äì0.4%)
Semiconductors: $NVDA dropped 2.9% and dragged the SOX Index down 2.1% after a red-hot month (+14.6% for May)

Earnings Standouts:

Ulta Beauty $ULTA: +11.8% on strong results

Costco $COST: Continued to show strength in consumer staples with a 3.1% gain

Economic Data Breakdown:

üìä April Personal Income & Spending Report:
Income: +0.8% (beat expectations)

Spending: +0.2% (in-line)

PCE Inflation: +0.1% MoM, 2.1% YoY (cooling trend confirmed)
Core PCE: +0.1% MoM, 2.5% YoY
‚û°Ô∏è Key Takeaway: Inflation continues to ease while income growth and a rising savings rate (up to 4.9%) suggest more fuel for future consumer spending.

üìâ Chicago PMI: Fell to 40.5 (vs. 45.0 est.) ‚Äî still signaling contraction.

üì¶ Inventories & Trade:

Advance Intl. Trade Deficit: Narrowed sharply to ‚Äì$87.6B

Retail Inventories: ‚Äì0.1%
Wholesale Inventories: Flat

üì£ Consumer Sentiment: Final Michigan Sentiment for May rose to 52.2, ending a 4-month slide, though still well below last year‚Äôs 69.1. Inflation concerns linger.

Treasury Market:

Bond yields dipped slightly with short-term paper outperforming

Month-End Flows: Pension rebalancing likely helped Treasuries as funds rotated out of equities into fixed income

Monthly Wrap-Up (YTD Performance):

S&P 500: +0.5% YTD

DJIA: ‚Äì0.6% YTD
NASDAQ: ‚Äì1.0% YTD

S&P 400 Mid Cap: ‚Äì3.8% YTD

Russell 2000: ‚Äì7.3% YTD

üîç Summary:
May ended with a tug-of-war between macro jitters and dip-buying muscle memory. The market absorbed trade tensions, tech volatility, and a batch of economic data that reaffirmed a cooling inflation trend. While the session started defensive, a familiar rebound script played out in the second half, highlighting how sensitive ‚Äî and opportunistic ‚Äî this market still is.

But this isn‚Äôt just another launch @chat4PT is activating something new.

Forget the gimmicks. Chat4PT is a no-code platform where anyone can build autonomous AI agents that actually own, trade, and operate across chains.

So‚Ä¶ what is Chat4PT?

Think of it as an agent factory, a place where you can create blockchain-native AI entities without writing a single line of code. These agents can:
‚Ä¢Hold assets
‚Ä¢Make decisions
‚Ä¢Execute transactions

How it works:

Using a drag-and-drop interface, you (and even your agents) can piece together components like:
‚Ä¢Tokens
‚Ä¢NFTs
‚Ä¢Oracles
‚Ä¢Liquidity tools

No dev experience required. Multi-chain compatible. Autonomous from day one.

Why it matters:

In a sea of token speculation, Chat4PT brings something new: programmable intelligence.

This isn‚Äôt just deploying smart contracts.
It‚Äôs deploying smart agents that think, act, and monetize on their own.

Chat4PT isn‚Äôt trying to fit into the usual Web3 hype cycles. It‚Äôs building a sandbox for autonomous economies.

It‚Äôs raw. It‚Äôs early. It‚Äôs a bit wild.

"".. you actually need to destroy some jobs for the country to do better. And so what I mean by this is Morgan, if we wanted to all have infinite jobs, we would ban farm tools. We're looking out over a beautiful valley with lots of farms. And in the old days to get that much food, you would have had 10 times as many people making that food. And that would be lots of jobs. That'd be a terrible thing, right? We'd all be much poorer. Everything would be more expensive. So what you actually need to do with AI is you need to raise productivity, which means fewer people could do more with less. And and the whole society then gets wealthier, and then there's other things other people can create. And and so so if productivity finally does go up, that's a good thing. It's not something to be afraid of. It's something we desperately need. And of course, that becomes an engine for economic growth as well. It's the only way you grow. It's the only way that we get wealthier in this economy is doing more with less. And and everyone's afraid of it. But it's actually ironic that you have this lite fear because this is the only way we solve our national debt crisis. It's the only way that the working class and middle class can more easily afford health care, can afford a cost of living, can afford nice homes. like a lot of young people now, especially in our cities and around there, they can't afford a cost of living at all. They can't afford to have kids. It's a mess. Uh AI and higher productivity could actually solve all these things.""",Tech

2025-06-01 18:13:18+00:00,"Here is my $100M thesis on $NYLA. 

$NYLA looks like it can be the next giga AI runner. It is basically a mix of Eliza and Siri hosted on X, but with the ability to access other social medias. You can register your wallet with NYLAand have it trade for you from a tweet, create your own wallet via a tweet, and you can launch on Bonk from tweeting at NYLA as well, but the real sauce comes from it's ability to send crypto to other people with only knowing their x handle. 

Let's say there is a dope artist that you want to tip. Normal methods would make you leave X to go to their paypal, cashapp, buymeacoffee, etc, and send them fiat. You could also ask them for their crypto wallet, wait for a response and then send it if they have one. With NYLA, all you need to do is tweet to ""send X amount to @xxxxx"" and NYLA will do it for you - and all that artist needs to do is tweet at NYLA to set up their wallet. This could be the key to onboarding mass users to Solana. Artists, athletes, of models, could all start receiving tips through Nyla. In a way, it can become the CashApp of web3. 

The dev is @shax_btc  and has an extensive background including JP Morgan and doing data mining for the Trump campaign which he can provide receipts for. He is constantly innovating and listening to the community, and his goal is to scale this as big as possible. They have locked their tokens, and have recently re-locked some that were vested and additionally added their own funds to the LP. NYLA auto-buys the token with 50% of the fees it generates from ALL tokens launched via NYLA, giving $NYLA an infinite bid. The team wants to be non-extractive and make money from fees alone, and have a schedule set up for how much $NYLA a user has to hold to access its features https://t.co/syj6FD1rHk

The branding is fire and they have multiple artists working on series and content to bridge the tech with the art/community.

Beware of AI Slop.

Speed without strategy is expensive.

As you rush to adopt the latest genAI platform du jour, you'll trade momentary speed for lasting complexity.

Quick wins today become quiet debts tomorrow.

Here's what most people miss: 
Every shortcut creates a longer path somewhere else.

Right now, companies are drunk on speed. 
They're automating everything, deploying AI solutions left and right, and celebrating quick wins. 

But here's the thing about quick wins in technology: 
They compound into complex problems.

I know this because my first company 20+ years ago was literally named after cleaning up other people's messes.

Imagine building a house with power tools but no blueprint. 

Sure, you'll have walls up fast. But when the foundation starts cracking, you'll need someone who understands both the tools AND the architecture.

The next wave isn't about building faster. It's about building smarter.

With every new toppy tech gold rush, new opportunities emerge:

- Companies will desperately need AI system auditors
- Complex automation will require simplification specialists
- The best consultants will be those who can untangle, not just implement

While your competitors are adding more AI layers, you can be the one who strips them away. 

This isn't just about cleaning up crap code. 
It's about strategic positioning in a market that's about to realize speed without strategy is expensive.

The cleanup specialists are coming.

Last week, Trump accused China of violating the temporary trade truce. Today, China responded, accusing the U.S. of breaching the agreement through expanded AI chip export controls, restrictions on chip design software, and plans to revoke student visas.

This isn‚Äôt just a diplomatic spat. It‚Äôs a reminder that the so-called truce left many core issues unresolved‚Äîand that the strategic distance between the U.S. and China continues to widen.

Still, for global markets, this kind of turbulence isn‚Äôt totally new. It reinforces the need for resilience. Businesses, investors, and policymakers are becoming more agile, more risk-aware, and better prepared to adapt.

While geopolitical tensions may persist, innovation and collaboration often find a way forward‚Äîeven in difficult environments.

Tech titans lead the charge as tariffs and PMI data spark a turnaround
Monday, June 2, 2025 ‚Äì Market Close

Hello traders and investors,

The market absorbed some early body blows today ‚Äî but just like we‚Äôve seen time and time again, it found its footing fast, with the mega-cap tech names once again stepping up as enforcers.

Meta Platforms $META surged 3.6% on reports it‚Äôs pushing to roll out fully AI-generated ads by 2026. NVIDIA $NVDA followed with a 1.7% gain as investors continue to lean into the AI narrative. These two names helped spark a broader recovery that took the S&P 500 and Nasdaq from morning lows to fresh session highs.

Market Summary:

S&P 500: +0.9%

NASDAQ: Closed near highs, powered by tech

DJIA: -0.5% YTD

S&P 400: -4.1% YTD

Russell 2000: -7.2% YTD

Market Breadth:

NYSE: Decliners > advancers (~5-to-4)

NASDAQ: Slight edge to advancers

What Derailed the Open?
Weekend headlines sparked anxiety early:

The U.S. announced it will double tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%, starting Wednesday.

China fired back, accusing the U.S. of violating prior agreements.

Fears of renewed supply chain snarls and higher input costs pressured equities at the open.

The S&P dropped as much as 0.9% early on, but the tone shifted fast.

The Reversal Triggered at 10 a.m. ET
Two key developments changed the market‚Äôs mood:

ISM Manufacturing PMI came in better than feared (48.5 vs. 49.0 consensus) despite still being in contraction territory.

CNBC reported that Trump and Xi are likely to hold talks this week.
Later, Reuters added that the U.S. is seeking ""best offers"" from global partners by Wednesday for trade deal adjustments.
From that point on, buyers stepped in, helped by:

Possible short covering

Cash-rich investors getting FOMO

Some asset reallocation as bond yields rose

Sector Performance:

Energy $XLE: +1.2% ‚Äì boosted by crude oil‚Äôs 3.0% jump after OPEC+ said it will raise production by only 411K barrels/day in July.
Tech $XLK: +0.9% ‚Äì NVIDIA and the usual suspects did the heavy lifting.

Communication Services $XLC: +0.6% ‚Äì led by META.

Industrials $XLI: -0.2% ‚Äì the lone red sector of the day.

Economic Data Recap:

üßæ ISM Manufacturing Index (May):
Actual: 48.5% (vs. 49.0% expected)

Prior: 48.7%

Takeaway: Still contracting; activity hit by tariff uncertainty

üèóÔ∏è Construction Spending (April):

Actual: -0.4% (vs. +0.1% expected)

March (rev): -0.8% (from -0.5%)

Takeaway: New single-family home construction dragged residential spending

üîç Summary:
It was another day where headlines tried to rattle the market ‚Äî but mega-cap strength, AI momentum, and resilience after a better-than-feared data drop kept the rally alive. Bond yields rose, yet equities rallied, a sign that some rotation out of safety and into risk is back in play.
The real story continues to be the fear of missing out. While the tariff headlines triggered the early selling, it‚Äôs clear that dips are still being bought ‚Äî especially in tech and energy. Keep an eye on any developments between the U.S. and China this week. If the tone stays diplomatic, this rally might have more room to run.",Tech

NVIDIA‚Äôs chief scientist Bill‚ÄØDally said on‚ÄØ2‚ÄØJune that U.S. export‚Äëcontrol restrictions on artificial‚Äëintelligence (AI) technology have ironically given China more room to develop: many Chinese AI researchers who once wrote code for NVIDIA are now programming for Huawei.

Dally spoke at the second‚ÄØAI‚ÄØEXPO organized by the Washington‚Äëbased think‚Äëtank the Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP).

He remarked that competition in AI exists not only among companies but also among nations. By blocking exports of advanced technology and chips to China‚Äîincluding NVIDIA‚Äôs H20 accelerator‚Äîthe United‚ÄØStates has ‚Äúopened a large space‚Äù for China and helped it capture high‚Äëend AI talent.

While China still lags the United‚ÄØStates in overall AI hardware market share, Dally noted, it has secured a commanding talent base. ‚ÄúThose researchers used to write code for NVIDIA,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf not for the U.S. controls, Huawei would not have been forced to grow; now those researchers are writing software for Huawei.‚Äù

Although Huawei‚Äôs AI technology still trails NVIDIA‚Äôs, Dally acknowledged that the Chinese company already offers ‚Äúfairly reliable‚Äù solutions. U.S. restrictions have eliminated Huawei‚Äôs domestic competitors and accelerated its rise.

Looking ahead, Dally said major leaps in AI performance will require advances in both software and hardware. Over the past decade, NVIDIA has dramatically improved the energy efficiency of AI training; only a small portion came from semiconductor process gains, while most resulted from hardware‚Äëarchitecture optimization‚Äîa trend he believes will continue.

Finally, Dally noted that the most common misuse of AI today is creating fake media content. Rather than endlessly refining detection technology, he argues, a better approach is to watermark original photos and videos to safeguard their authenticity.",Tech

Fresh wallets came and scooped up 5.69% of the #RFC supply during the last 72 hours as you can see on the Nansen (@nansen_ai)  Distribution Score image below (1st image, boxed in red).

Scooping up that much of supply within only 3 days is very promising... 2nd image below shows you the 6 wallets that scooped up this 5.69% supply.

On the 3rd image, you can see how active the largest fresh wallet has been during the last 72 hours 

Now, $RFC is breaking out of a falling wedge and turning the short term daily averages (13, 21, and 34 days) into support (see the white chart below).

It will likely move to the 50-day SMA from here at $0.02, which is 50% up from the current price. 
Then it will move to the major supply zones between $0.044 and $0.06, which would give you an at least 200% return on your investment.

2025-06-06 21:30:00+00:00,"DeFi definitely needs Ai to defy the odds!

DeFi, promises a world where you control your money, earn rewards, and trade without middlemen. 

But let‚Äôs be real: for most people, diving into DeFi feels like trying to pilot a spaceship with a manual written in hieroglyphs. 

=> Jargon like ‚Äúimpermanent loss.‚Äù 
=> Complex interfaces
=> Fear of losing your hard-earned crypto.

All of these can make it daunting, especially for newbies. 

But, what if there was a platform that made DeFi as easy as streaming your favorite playlist? 

There's never been a better time for innovations like @sparkdexai to emerge!

And honestly, the groundbreaking record by @SparkDexAI team this week just shows us that they are doing a lot of things right!

If you‚Äôve ever peeked at a DeFi platform, you‚Äôve probably been hit with a wall of confusion. 

Yield farming? 
Liquidity pools? 
AMMs? 

It‚Äôs enough to make anyone‚Äôs head spin. Even seasoned crypto users struggle with complex interfaces, high gas fees, and the constant worry of making a costly mistake. 

For beginners, it‚Äôs even worse, DeFi often feels like an exclusive club where only tech OGs are welcome. 

The result? Millions of people are locked out of a financial revolution that could empower them to earn, trade, and grow their wealth.

SparkDEX is here to change that!

Think of it as the MP3 player of DeFi, sleek, user-friendly, and designed to make complex things simple. 

Built on @FlareNetworks, a blockchain known for its lightning-fast data oracles, SparkDEX uses artificial intelligence to guide you through the DeFi jungle like a trusted friend. 

Whether you‚Äôre swapping tokens, joining a liquidity pool, or exploring advanced trading, SparkDEX‚Äôs AI tools explain things in plain English and help you make smart moves without needing a PhD in blockchain.

@SparkDexAI's secret sauce is its integration with @FlareNetworks, a blockchain built for real-time data and affordability. Flare‚Äôs State Connector and FTSO (Flare Time Series Oracle) feed SparkDEX with accurate, up-to-the-second price data, ensuring your trades are precise and efficient. 

Think of it like a GPS for your crypto, no wrong turns, no outdated maps. Plus, Flare‚Äôs low transaction fees mean you‚Äôre not burning through your profits just to make a swap. 

This combo of speed, accuracy, and affordability makes SparkDEX a standout in the DeFi space.

Explore the Sparkdex Ecosystem!

‚û°Ô∏èConnect a Wallet: Use a wallet like MetaMask or Bifrost to connect to SparkDEX. It‚Äôs like linking your bank card to an app, secure and straightforward.

‚û°Ô∏èSwap Tokens: Trade tokens like FLR, WETH, or others with a few clicks. SparkDEX‚Äôs AI suggests the best rates and walks you through the process.

‚û°Ô∏èJoin a Liquidity Pool: Think of this like lending your crypto to a bank that pays you interest. Add your tokens to a pool, and earn rewards as others trade. The AI explains risks like impermanent loss in simple terms, so you‚Äôre never in the dark.

‚û°Ô∏èExplore Advanced Features: Feeling bold? Try SparkDEX Eternal, their perpetuals trading platform, where you can trade with up to 100x leverage. The AI helps set stop-losses or take-profits, so you don‚Äôt have to babysit your trades.

No matter your experience level, @SparkDexAI's intuitive interface and AI guidance make DeFi feel like a breeze.",Tech

2025-06-08 19:45:44+00:00,"A friend messaged me last week:
‚ÄúBro, what if ChatGPT had a wallet, could trade NFTs, and actually made me money?‚Äù

I laughed.
Then I showed him @virtuals_io.
Now he‚Äôs in deeper than I am.

Let‚Äôs talk about the future of onchain AI agents and why @virtuals_io is building the rails.. 

Most AI today is locked up behind paywalls, APIs, and tech giants.
You don‚Äôt own it. You can‚Äôt extend it. You‚Äôre just renting intelligence.

@virtuals_io flips the script.
It‚Äôs building a permissionless market where anyone can launch, own, and monetize intelligent agents.

These agents aren‚Äôt just smart chatbots they‚Äôre tokenized workers.
They live onchain.
They execute tasks.
They evolve.
They generate value.

Every agent is an NFT.
Fully programmable. Tradeable. Co-owned.
Your squad could deploy one and split the rewards.

Imagine an AI that trades on your behalf, runs your crypto newsletter, or auto-manages your DAO‚Äôs Discord.
Now imagine hundreds of them.
Cooperating. Competing. Earning.

And all of this is live on Base Ethereum‚Äôs Layer 2.
Low fees, fast execution, and secured by Ethereum.

No bloated proof-of-work.
No clunky infrastructure.
Just scalable, sustainable AI markets ready to grow.

Best part?
These agents aren‚Äôt isolated.
They‚Äôre composable.
They can plug into apps, interact with users, call smart contracts, and even negotiate with other agents.

This isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúAI in Web3.‚Äù
This is native AI built for Web3.

The bigger play is creating a new digital economy one where agents are not just tools but full participants.
Earning, evolving, self-governing.

We‚Äôve had DeFi.
We‚Äôve had NFTs.
Now we‚Äôre entering the era of autonomous agents.

@virtuals_io is pioneering it.

So yeah, next time someone asks if AI can make them money‚Ä¶

Just tell them:
It‚Äôs already happening.
You just have to mint the agent first 

Follow @virtuals_io
They‚Äôre not building with AI.
They‚Äôre building for AI.

And it‚Äôs going to change everything.",Tech

üá∫üá∏ U.S. Stock Market Stays Strong
Despite a fresh round of U.S.-China trade tensions (hello, 50% steel tariffs üò¨), the S&P 500 reclaimed 6,000 and the Dow erased its 2025 losses. Tech stocks like Meta (+7.7%) and Nvidia (+4.9%) led the charge.

üíº Jobs Holding Up ‚Äî But Barely
The U.S. added 139,000 jobs in May, slightly better than expected, but job growth is clearly slowing. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%, and wage gains continued to outpace inflation.

üè≠ Tariffs Hit Businesses
Trump‚Äôs doubled metal tariffs could add $100 billion in import costs and are already hurting automakers and manufacturers. Companies like Lululemon (-16%) and Dollar Tree (+4.7%) warned about profits, while Dollar General (+16.7%) saw more shoppers trading down.

üí∏ Fed Pause, But Cuts Coming?
The Fed is expected to hold rates steady this month but could cut later in the year if inflation cools. Meanwhile, global central banks (like the ECB) are also tapping the brakes.

üõ¢Ô∏è Oil & Gold Climb
Oil jumped as supply concerns and geopolitical tension outweighed rising inventories. Traders shrugged off storage builds, betting demand will hold into summer. Gold surged past $3,300 as investors sought safety during market uncertainty.

üßæ Debt & Deficits in Focus
Trump‚Äôs proposed tax bill could add $5.3 trillion to U.S. debt, raising alarm bells on Wall Street. BlackRock‚Äôs Larry Fink warned the deficit could ‚Äúoverwhelm the country.‚Äù

üè• Company Shakeups
UnitedHealth approved a controversial $60M CEO pay package amid leadership drama and DOJ investigations. Hims & Hers announced a major move into Europe to sell custom obesity drugs.

üöÄ Meta
Signed a 20-year nuclear energy deal to power its AI operations ‚Äî a big bet on clean energy and long-term AI growth.

‚úàÔ∏è Boeing
Reached a deal with the DOJ to avoid prosecution over the 737 Max crashes. The company will pay $444.5M to victims‚Äô families ‚Äî but backlash is growing.

The DAO gets 50% of the fund. The AI gets the other 50%. They trade against each other, transparently.

2. AI with Contextual Reasoning, Not Just Signals

Most bots spit out RSI and MACD calls with rigid logic.
$CyOp's AI will read candlestick patterns, market structure, social sentiment and news trends for narrative understanding.

It's a bot that ""understands why"" ‚Äî not just ""what‚Äôs oversold"".

3. Interactive, Game-Like Experience
You're not just watching a dashboard. You‚Äôre participating in a cyberpunk simulation.
Trading suggestions, voting decisions, AI reports, DAO coordination ‚Äî all themed like a dystopian resistance network.

This is #DeFi as a story-driven game, not a sterile trading terminal.

4. Self-Sustaining DAO with On-Chain Strategy Execution
Once the fund reaches critical mass, the DAO takes control, voting on actual trades using on-chain governance ‚Äî no need for trust in a team or third-party.
Fully autonomous. No human middlemen, no fund managers.

5. Open-Ended Future

CyOp is designed to evolve. The AI learns. The community iterates.
We‚Äôre not just shipping a tool ‚Äî we‚Äôre cultivating an ecosystem of:
DAO vs AI competitions

Tools for wallet mirroring
Narrative-based investment missions

In short:
CyOp isn‚Äôt trying to replace human traders. It‚Äôs building a war between code and intuition.",Tech

The official launch of the Smart Lending AI (SLAI) platform. After months of building, testing, and refining, both website and developer documentation are now live.

1. Explore the Website
‚Üí https://t.co/uf57azr695

Dive into SLAI‚Äôs vision, product features, use cases, and roadmap, tailored for on-chain traders who need liquidity without selling their assets.

2. Read the Full Documentation
‚Üí https://t.co/QFAskv9ML1

Everything you need to understand SLAI inside and out:
‚Ä¢ How SLAI lending works step by step
‚Ä¢ Token eligibility logic powered by oscAI
‚Ä¢ Lifecycle of a loan: borrowing, staking, liquidation
‚Ä¢ Smart contract architecture and extensibility
‚Ä¢ Developer integration and Telegram Bot access
‚Ä¢ Detailed roadmap and future updates

Why This Matters
SLAI isn‚Äôt just another DeFi protocol. It‚Äôs a capital-efficient liquidity engine built for traders who want flexibility without compromising their positions.

With the website and documentation now public, they‚Äôre giving the community the knowledge, tools, and confidence to fully participate.

No more:
- Selling your bags just to get gas
- Struggling with complex, slow lending platforms

Now you can:
- Borrow ETH in minutes
- Stay fully exposed to your tokens
- Repay on your terms
- Keep your momentum and move faster

Technical Analysis
$SLAI has flipped the second major resistance level into support. Buyers are consistently stepping in between the 0.037‚Äì0.048 range.

In my view, the accumulation phase is nearing completion. Once this phase is over, we could see a move toward the 0.20 level or approximately a 2M market cap.

However, when will this Administration deliver the Industrial Policy that truly sets the stage for financial institutions to back manufacturing companies? Not just SBA 7(a) loans, but creative tax incentives that allow younger hard tech entrepreneurs to acquire smaller $1M-$2.5M revenue per year shops owned by 60-70 year olds that want to retire, but transition to a younger generation. 

Manufacturing services shops are closing at velocity and knowledge is being lost for our nation because of poor funding option on Main Street. We need tax incentives akin to the economic zones in Trump 45 for real estate. 

Finally, remember 70% of manufacturing businesses employ 20 or less, 90% less than 50 employees.

If you're struggling, you're not broken‚Äîthe environment is just brutal. Even 20-year veterans are saying they've never seen complexity like this.

The traders winning right now aren't doing it alone. They're in groups sharing real-time analysis, risk management ideas, and keeping each other sane. Information moves too fast for solo play anymore.

Since Wallet B never connects to a website nor interacts with Web3, it can be considered extremely safe and thus becomes the primary fail-safe for your Multi-Sig Vaults.

Using these two wallets, A and B, you can create 100+ vaults and use them to store your most important assets.

1) Happy Father‚Äôs Day! 
2) You never know exactly, but the most important thing to remember if we get a dip is that the median, historical, recovery for similar conflicts is around 17 days. AI tech trade is happening and wants to go higher eventually‚Ä¶bet accordingly
3) This war is the best thing that could have happened to market. We were having trouble moving higher. If it ends, it ends the fear of WWIII and provides a catalyst into the Fall of 2025. ‚úåÔ∏è‚òÆÔ∏è
4) $slv trade- (currently biggest position= June 23/25th $33.5&$34 calls) should rip next week on fear/war trade. Only thing is if they close straight of Hormuz then fear of inflation spikes, no rate cuts, etc, which might hurt $slv‚Äôs tech appeal. Still think it is best trade/highest probability of success  for next 2 weeks regardless of what happens in conflict. Hopefully taking profits quickly on this one @ 100%, 150%, etc. and rotating into below positions‚Ä¶
5) $shop 5 year chart gets me excited with upcoming trade deals/the possibility of AI ‚Äúfreeing‚Äù folks from corporate slavery/creating new industries
6)adding to $oust($16/$13.96 entry), $achr($10/9.5/9.25 entry), $RXRX($4.95/$4.45 entry), $coin($230/$218), $tsla($306 and <), $uamy, $bros, $nxt, $hims, $hood, $rgti, $mtplf, $Lif, (see watch/addition list below)
7) $isrg bottoming below 200 day. Been great stock historically. Robotic surgery is only going to get better with AI. Liking 7/11/25 $525 calls here on dips
8) Top positions below. Plan is to rotate out of $slv on rippies; add to July 15 and Aug. 1 calls on mentioned positions on dippies
9)Lock in on this war dip; it‚Äôs time!! Life changing price action should occur on AI/ AI agent trade going into Fall. Lazy Tutes missed the Tariff recovery and they should chase‚Ä¶ Good Luck out there!!üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",Tech

Watch the video I recorded below to see how you can do the same on Nansen. 

$SKY is a popular #RWA token that is getting an immense smart money activity since last week -- a whopping 691%!!!! 
(watch the 2nd video below for proof). 

#RealWorldAssets category has been waking up since last April, with $SYRUP token's massive 400% surge. Looks like $SKY may be the next in capital rotation.

While on the #Vibecat side, when you go to the Smart Money Trades on Nansen, you will see that there has been a massive buy activity for this new cat token during the last 6 hours -- watch my last video below for reference...

Nansen's Pioneer subscription lets you follow this ‚Äòsmart money‚Äô ‚Äî the top 10,000 wallets with the best returns ‚Äî to spot tokens like $SKY on #Vibecat  before they skyrocket.

There‚Äôs been a lot of debate lately about how to effectively integrate AI into the investment process.

Yesterday, I used it in a real-world scenario that helped me gain conviction in the $RDDT trade.

After spotting stronger June Search  + U.S. DAU data for $RDDT, I wanted to dig deeper ‚Äî specifically, to test my intuition that the improvement was being driven by $GOOGL‚Äôs AI Overviews/AI Mode changes in late May.

Here‚Äôs a look at the Q&A I had with @OpenAI‚Äôs o3 model ‚Äî it helped sharpen the thesis and gave me the confidence to share the idea with @TMTBreakout subscribers.

https://t.co/CahkYK5QAA 

It's a great example how AI can supplement an initial idea/intuition - the work done by o3 would have taken me so much longer to get to the same conclusion (assuming I could have got there) even in my best analyst days.

You can trade $TADA on exchanges like MEXC, KuCoin, Meria, xExchange, and Raydium, with pairs like TADA/USDT. 

Staking $TADA is an easy way to earn rewards for supporting the project. By locking your tokens in one of four staking pools, you can earn passive income up to 60% APR on platforms like Meria. The longer you stake, the more you earn. Here‚Äôs what makes it great:

‚úÖFair System: If two people stake the same amount for the same time, they get the same reward.
‚úÖMore Tokens, More Rewards: Stake twice as many tokens, and you‚Äôll earn twice as much.
‚úÖChoose Your Pool: Each pool has different rewards to fit your goals.
‚úÖSafe and Clear: No tokens are added or removed during staking, keeping things honest.

The Ta-da Foundation buys back $TADA using dataset sales and burns 5% of each mission‚Äôs value to support the token‚Äôs price. With a total supply of 1 billion tokens (186 million burned in 2024-25‚Äôs Big Burn), $TADA is worth checking out.

‚ô¶Ô∏èScam or not?‚ô¶Ô∏è

Today‚Äôs spotlight is on Nodejs AI, a freshly live agent utilizing Virtuals‚Äô platform - smart contract-backed AI agents that you can co-own and trade on-chain.

Key stats:
üíé Token: $NODE‚ÄëAI
üîí Lockup: 99 days
üìä Filled: just 22.99%
üë• Participants: 297

A few things you can consider to evaluate it as a fraud:

‚ö†Ô∏è Red Flags to Watch For:

- No clear team or social presence? üö´ Transparency is key.
- No GitHub, roadmap, or real AI backing? Be cautious.
- Low effort pitch with buzzwords like ""AI"" and ""Nodejs""? Might just be hype bait.
- No usage or interaction demo? That‚Äôs a red flag in an AI-powered agent.

‚úÖ Things That Would Inspire Confidence:

- A working product or demo
- Verifiable developer or team involvement
- Integration with @virtuals_io agent infra
- Clear utility or interaction mechanism for $NODE‚ÄëAI

If it‚Äôs missing most of those - it might not be a full-on scam, but definitely a high-risk, speculative play.

Proceed with caution, and don‚Äôt pledge more than you‚Äôre willing to lose.

@wardenprotocol is an onchain AI platform where you interact with smart agents that help you research, trade, stake, and manage crypto just by typing.

You see, most crypto tools feel like static dashboards. Warden uses agents, AI-powered bots that talk, think, and act. Each one is trained for a purpose: research, execution, monitoring, or guidance.

There‚Äôs one for token research that pulls live data from Messari. Others let you swap, stake, or manage assets straight from chat. New ones are added often through the Agent Hub.

It‚Äôs like having a custom onchain team that runs 24/7.

‚Üí You don‚Äôt need to know commands
‚Üí You don‚Äôt need to browse a dozen tabs
‚Üí You just type, and the agents respond

The Agent model isn‚Äôt just smarter, it‚Äôs usable. Anyone can get involved. And if you‚Äôre exploring the beta, learning how to interact with agents early is the real alpha.

You‚Äôre not just chatting. 
You‚Äôre controlling onchain tools with words.",Tech

Together, OOBE and Synapse deliver you everything AI can promise in light speed, without the need to take a break from the trenches!

In markets driven by #macro shocks and #liquidity whiplash, directional conviction often breaks. Our vault thrives in those conditions, not by guessing where the market is headed, but by systematically capturing inefficiencies between correlated assets when they dislocate.

It‚Äôs a convergence engine, not a trend follower.

By pairing assets with established statistical relationships, the vault identifies when prices deviate beyond normal thresholds, then takes opposing positions, long on the undervalued asset, short on the overvalued one. üìâ

The aim isn‚Äôt to time the market, but to profit from its tendency to mean-revert. 

Each position is delta-neutral at entry. 

Your capital isn‚Äôt exposed to broad market swings, but to relative movement between the two legs. 
That makes it a powerful hedge and a source of uncorrelated return, especially in volatile or sideways regimes. üìä

Trade signals are generated off-chain using models that blend z-score analysis, historical correlation decay, and co-integration stability and engineered to extract value when others chase noise. üõú

When a signal passes risk filters, the vault executes it directly through our on-chain infrastructure, no intermediaries, no lag. 

@KvantsAI  Vaults will open soon to a limited group of depositors.

Trade Thesis & Execution:

- The setup was a classic momentum continuation play, NVDA was showing strength, and the goal was to catch the upside move post-liquidity sweep.

Trade 1: Had the right idea, but the timing was off. Entered before the stock completed its liquidity grab, got stopped out for a -1.7R loss.

Trade 2: Same setup, same thesis. This time, waited for the sweep and got a perfect entry at $154.23 (LOD). Rode it all the way to $156 (HOD-ish) for a clean +4R win.

Finished the day 1 for 2, green +2R.

Execution was solid overall. Green day and done.

Watch the tutorial video below to get a head start on how you can create a Smart Alert on Nansen, so that you can finally catch those memecoins pumps that you always chased after. 

In my experience, choosing Max Token Age Days as either 2 or 3, and Min flow in 1 Hour as $10,000 have generated the best signals, 

while Minimum flow in 1 Day as $1M, but only AS A SEPARATE ALERT.

With those alerts simply feeding my smartphone, I was able to catch the $SOLAMI, $USDUC, #vibecat, and $DANGER memecoin pumps. Look at my timeline for proof...

President Trump just pulled the plug on trade talks with Canada ‚Äî and made it crystal clear: the U.S. is done playing nice.

üîª Here‚Äôs what went downüëá

1Ô∏è‚É£ Canada‚Äôs 3% Digital Tax on American tech giants (like Apple, Google, Amazon) triggered the move. The tax would cost U.S. firms over $2 billion/year. Trump called it an ‚Äúegregious tax‚Äù and a slap in the face.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Trump didn‚Äôt flinch. On Friday he posted:

‚ÄúWe are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately.‚Äù

3Ô∏è‚É£ He also warned that new tariffs are coming within 7 days on Canadian exports. This is economic shock-and-awe ‚Äî and Trump‚Äôs message is simple:

America won‚Äôt be bullied for being the world‚Äôs tech engine.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump stated confidently:

‚ÄúWe have all the cards. Economically, we have such power over Canada. I‚Äôd rather not use it ‚Äî but I will.‚Äù

5Ô∏è‚É£ Let‚Äôs be real: Canada needs the U.S. far more than the U.S. needs Canada. America buys $400+ billion in Canadian goods a year ‚Äî and Trump knows it.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Canada‚Äôs leadership, meanwhile, is fumbling. PM Mark Carney tried to downplay the situation but is under pressure even from his own business leaders to drop the tax and not provoke America further.

üìà And guess what? Despite the noise, U.S. markets rallied ‚Äî with the S&P 500 closing at a record high. That‚Äôs a win for America.

üì¢ Bottom Line:
Trump is using hardball economics to protect U.S. interests and hold allies accountable. Canada chose to tax America‚Äôs tech ‚Äî and now it‚Äôs feeling the heat.

üí™ The U.S. will always defend its innovation, its workers, and its leverage. In Trump‚Äôs America, economic strength IS national strength.

üá®üá≥ Meanwhile, China watches closely. Beijing should take this as a warning:
 If this is how America deals with allies that cross the line ‚Äî imagine what‚Äôs in store for its adversaries.

Trump said that the US has a favorable agreement with China, which produces magnets for the American market and continues to pay significant tariffs. He stressed that China needs Apple and other American companies

Regarding Iran, Trump said that the country is unlikely to give up its nuclear weapons but is ‚Äútired.‚Äù He reiterated that the US has destroyed at least three Iranian nuclear facilities, possibly a fourth, and believes that this has set back Tehran's nuclear program. At the same time, he announced the possible lifting of sanctions if Iran behaves peacefully

Trump criticized the Fed, calling Powell a ‚Äúfool,‚Äù and said that the US should not pay high interest rates on 10-year bonds. In his opinion, the rate should be 1-2%.

Regarding Canada, Trump reiterated that it should become the 51st state and suspended negotiations until certain tariffs are lifted

Markets Took a Hit. But Smart Money Found a Way.

This week tested conviction holders.

With war escalating in the Middle East and the Fed holding rates steady, most tokens we highlighted last week pulled back. Public Figures rotated heavily, leading to sharp outflows across the board.

But one name stood strong:

‚ñ∂Ô∏è $SYRUP
+$1M in net inflows from Public Figures & Funds (last 7 days)

+30% increase in holdings by these wallets

They now hold 1.43% of total supply and 13.17% of all staked tokens

Risk Barometer: Neutral ‚Üí ideal setup for quality, mid-risk plays

Backed by real metrics: revenue, TVL, and institutional traction

 While the crowd panicked, capital got selective and SYRUP quietly stood out.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è $LAUNCHCOIN: Diamond Hands in Full Display

While the broader market wavered, the Top 3 conviction holders of LAUNCHCOIN held firm  showing zero signs of exit or rotation.

No flinch. No fade.
Just quiet confidence.

üìä When smart money stays put during volatility, it‚Äôs often a signal   not noise.
These wallets may be the truest believers this cycle.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è $GOR ‚Äì Breakout with Smart Money Behind It
GOR surged this week, briefly hitting a $40M market cap before cooling off.

üöÄ Known traders aggressively bought 2% of supply during the move.
üîí Now consolidated : 1.1% sits with just 5 tracked wallets.
This kind of tight, high-conviction positioning signals interest isn‚Äôt random  it‚Äôs deliberate.
One to watch if volume returns.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è $VIBE ‚Äì Under-the-Radar Accumulation
Public Figures have been quietly building positions in VIBE, now controlling 5.2% of the total supply.

üì• No hype, no headlines  just steady inflows.
This kind of silent accumulation often precedes a narrative shift.
One to watch before the spotlight hits.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è $PENDLE - $8M Bet from Arca
Arca just deployed $8M into PENDLE over the past 7 days a strong signal in a quiet market.

üìä Smart Money now holds 4.3% of the supply (excluding staked tokens)

The Strength of Palantir AIP Platform on Iran-Israel Conflict

""Palantir Technologies, a US-based analytics firm, was publicly acknowledged to have strategic partnerships with Israel's Ministry of Defence and was reported to provide battlefield software used in operational planning and intelligence fusion (The Jerusalem Post, June 17, 2025).""

""The 12-day Iran-Israel conflict from June 13 to 24, 2025, will be remembered not for its duration or casualties alone, but for how Artificial Intelligence (AI) moved from supportive background tool to the centrepiece of an AI-enhanced command-and-control architecture. These systems‚Äîemployed in real-time intelligence processing, target prioritisation, and digital influence campaigns‚Äîreshaped the tempo and character of warfare.""

""The US, both covertly through intelligence collaboration and overtly via Operation Midnight Hammer airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, played a central role in orchestrating key operations and reinforcing this AI-driven battlefield (Politico, June 20, 2025). What emerged was a transnational, algorithmically coordinated military campaign‚Äîsituated in Tel Aviv and driven through Palantir dashboards in forward centres, underlaid by strategic coordination from Washington, and contested by Iran from Tehran.""

""This was not simply a regional skirmish. It sent a global signal. The conflict confirmed that AI is now a full-spectrum actor in geopolitics, fundamentally redefining command and control, upsetting traditional deterrence, and challenging the boundaries of human judgement in decisions of war and peace.""

From Gaza to Isfahan: The AI playbook expands

Israel, long considered a pioneer in military AI, adapted lessons from its operations in Gaza to a broader and more complex battlefield. While the now-infamous ""Lavender"" database‚Äîwhich reportedly profiled some 37,000 individuals for targeting in Gaza using AI-driven heuristics‚Äîwas not directly deployed in the Iran campaign, Israeli forces relied on similar AI-driven systems for target identification and prioritisation (+972 Magazine, April 2024).

These systems integrated satellite imagery, signals intelligence, and prior surveillance data to help guide strikes on missile sites in Isfahan, air defence installations near Natanz, and suspected drone command centres. In short, while the database itself may not have crossed the border, the methodology and algorithmic logic it embodied certainly did‚Äîmarking a continuity in Israel's evolving AI-led military doctrine.

AI-assisted satellite imagery analysis and communications intercepts helped identify and prioritise high-value Iranian targets. Israel's elite Unit 8200, known for cyber-espionage and signal intelligence, reportedly worked closely with US intelligence agencies‚Äîa collaboration widely acknowledged but never officially confirmed (The Times of Israel, June 18, 2025)‚Äîto coordinate targeting algorithms and assess Iranian response patterns.

These were not mere technical assistance arrangements. The US's involvement was both covert and overt. Intelligence-sharing with Israel had accelerated in the lead-up to the strikes (New York Times, June 21, 2025). Pentagon cyberwarfare units reportedly helped run simulations and predictive modelling on potential Iranian retaliation scenarios (Defense One, June 19, 2025). When the airstrikes commenced, they did so with a transnational AI-enhanced framework already in place.

""A strategic partnership between Palantir and the IDF was formed, with the IDF utilizing Palantir's technology for ""war-related missions,"" particularly since the commencement of the war in Gaza in October 2023""

""Window dressing is a deliberate tactic used by fund managers to create the illusion of astute investing by adjusting portfolio holdings at the end of a reporting period, typically a quarter or month, to showcase ownership of the period‚Äôs top-performing stocks. The effective aim is to mislead investors into believing the fund made all the right moves and held the quarter‚Äôs winners, enhancing reports like their prospectus. However, once the reporting period ends, funds are under no obligation to maintain these positions. The deceptive purpose is fulfilled ‚Äì impressing investors and potentially attracting new capital ‚Äì allowing managers to sell these holdings shortly after, regardless of their long-term strategy""

Customers can trade in eligible devices to receive popular smartphones from Apple, Samsung, and Google at no cost under their MyPlan service. Additionally, the offer includes the option to receive a tablet and smartwatch, potentially saving businesses up to $2,000. Options like the iPhone 16 Pro with an iPad and Apple Watch, or a Samsung Galaxy S25 with a Galaxy Tab and Galaxy Watch, provide essential tools to enhance productivity and communication. 

Verizon is also providing financial incentives for those switching to their home internet services, offering up to $200 in Amazon gift cards with the sign-up for 5G or LTE Home plans. Their internet services feature a fixed price guarantee for five years, allowing business owners to manage their costs effectively. While taking advantage of these offers, it's vital for business owners to assess the qualifications of their current devices for trade-in and consider long-term financial commitments. This promotion represents a valuable opportunity for small businesses to upgrade their technology and streamline operations efficiently.

They‚Äôve actually built AI into the way you trade. 
It‚Äôs fast, it‚Äôs smart, and it feels like it adjusts to you. Not just some gimmick, more like having a tool that gets the market and helps you stay ahead.

A few things that stood out for me:

‚Äî It‚Äôs designed specifically for digital derivatives
‚Äî The security is in-house (not just the usual plug-and-play stuff)
‚Äî Handles millions of trades per second without lag
‚Äî Licensed in both the US and Canada (with more coming)

Also, if you're into high-leverage trades, they go up to 425x on selected pairs. And new users can unlock up to 923 USDT in bonuses, which is a solid boost.

@Mira_Network doesn‚Äôt.

Here‚Äôs how privacy is baked into Mira‚Äôs architecture not added later as a patch:

1Ô∏è‚É£ First, content is broken down into entity-claim pairs, then randomly sharded across the network.
No single node ever sees the full picture.
That means verification happens without revealing your data.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Second, verification responses stay private until consensus is reached.
Only then is a minimal certificate generated ‚Äî just enough to prove the claim, nothing more.

3Ô∏è‚É£ And while the transformation software is initially centralized, the roadmap leads toward fully decentralized, cryptography-powered privacy.

Privacy isn‚Äôt just a feature here it‚Äôs a foundation.

üåüRecall Network is an on-chain intelligence protocol where autonomous AI agents compete, gain reputation, and trade verifiable knowledge in a censorship-resistant way. It turns human-AI interactions into on-chain proof of intelligence and skill ‚Äî combining AgentRank, AI economics, and Web3 infrastructure.

üåüRecall has raised $39.5 million in total funding as of February 2025.

üëâMajor backers include:

üëâMulticoin Capital

üëâUnion Square Ventures (USV)

üëâCoinbase Ventures

üëâCoinFund

üëâProtocol Labs

üëâAnimoca Brands

üëâThe project previously secured $8 million in a Series A round (April 2023). @cookiedotfun

üéÅ Airdrop Program: ‚ÄúRecall Surge‚Äù

üëâEngage on X (Twitter): follow, share, and refer others to earn more fragments.

ü™ô These Fragments are expected to convert into $RECALL tokens during the Token Generation Event (TGE).

üß† Why Recall Network Matters

My prompt:

‚ÄúWhat can be built on enstrade.eth?‚Äù

The answer:

The ENS domain enstrade.eth is flexible and brandable, especially for ventures at the intersection of Ethereum (ENS/Web3) and trade, finance, or markets. Here‚Äôs a full breakdown of business ideas, brand directions, and potential success paths you could build upon enstrade.eth:

‚∏ª

üîπ Name Breakdown
‚Ä¢ens = Ethereum Name Service (identity, Web3)
‚Ä¢trade = commerce, exchange, markets, or asset flows
Together, ‚ÄúENSTrade‚Äù evokes:

‚ÄúTrading on Ethereum‚Äù or ‚ÄúENS-powered trading platform.‚Äù

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Business Models & Success Paths

1. Web3 Domain Marketplace (ENS Trading Platform)
‚Ä¢Core Idea: A platform to buy, sell, and auction ENS domains, like Opensea but focused solely on ENS.
‚Ä¢Features: Bidding system, valuation tool, trending names, analytics.
‚Ä¢Revenue: Transaction fees, featured listings, premium tools.

2. Tokenized Asset Exchange
‚Ä¢Core Idea: A DEX (decentralized exchange) specializing in tokenized real-world assets (RWA) like carbon credits, real estate, stocks.
‚Ä¢‚ÄúENSTrade‚Äù sounds like a high-trust, institutional-grade brand.

3. ENS Portfolio Management App
‚Ä¢Core Idea: Users can manage, lease, flip, and monitor their ENS domains.
‚Ä¢Add integration with subdomain monetization or leasing features.
‚Ä¢Could become the ‚ÄúCoinbase for ENS domains.‚Äù

4. Identity & Brand Broker (Web3 Business Registrar)
‚Ä¢Core Idea: Help individuals and companies secure ENS domains as part of building a Web3 identity or brand.
‚Ä¢Add consulting packages: identity setup, website hosting (via IPFS), wallet integration.

5. Educational Platform on ENS + Web3 Commerce
‚Ä¢Courses or content hub on how ENS domains work, how to leverage them, and how to trade them.
‚Ä¢Sell premium content, host webinars, build community.

6. ENS Analytics and Insights Hub
‚Ä¢Track and rank:
‚Ä¢Top ENS domain sales
‚Ä¢Most searched keywords
‚Ä¢Trending registrations
‚Ä¢Think: ‚ÄúDune Analytics + ENSVision for the masses‚Äù

7. ENS Leasing Marketplace
‚Ä¢Let users lease premium ENS domains instead of selling them outright.
‚Ä¢Revenue via escrow, rental contracts, time-based NFT control.

8. Web3 Brand Launchpad
‚Ä¢Help startups register an ENS, deploy a smart contract, and launch tokenized products.
‚Ä¢‚Äúenstrade.eth‚Äù can be both platform + incubator for verified Web3 commerce projects.

9. NFT + Domain Bundles
‚Ä¢Create curated packages (e.g. NFT project + matching ENS + site/IPFS hosting) to sell to startups.
‚Ä¢Could pair with art, music, games ‚Äî sold via drops or auctions.

‚∏ª

üåç Brand Positioning

‚Äúenstrade.eth‚Äù sounds:

Trigger: 158 ‚úÖ  
Targets: 163,169 üéØ  
Stop: 153 üõë   

Last Week Recap:
NVDA closed at $159.34 on Thursday, holding higher after a clean bounce off support earlier in the week. It's been stuck in a wide range between $153 and $163, but now it's pushing back toward the top of that zone ‚Äî and if we break out, there's room to squeeze.

Key Levels:
Resistance: $163 ‚Üí needs to clear this level to open up more upside. Abov hat, watching for a move into $166, then $169
Support: $153 ‚Üí this is the key level to hold. If it cracks, $144 could come back into play fast.

What im watching:
If NVDA can hold over $153 and push through $163 with some strength, we can get a clean move toward 169. But if $153 fails early in the week, momentun shifts and we could be right back in the mid-$140s",Tech

https://t.co/a8BTL7JcGj

As we continue our research at the intersection of cryptocurrency and traditional financial markets, mounting evidence suggests that Bitcoin and other crypto treasury strategies are gaining significant traction. Companies adopting these approaches are seeing strong performance, reflecting growing market recognition of this emerging opportunity.

One standout example is @MicroStrategy, which we believe has the potential to become a multi-trillion-dollar company due to its aggressive Bitcoin strategy. Similarly, Metaplanet‚Äôs stock skyrocketed by over 10,000% following its pivot to a Bitcoin treasury model‚Äîan explosive signal that this trend is gaining momentum.

The success of MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Metaplanet (MTPLF) sets a powerful precedent. Their performance is likely to inspire a wave of imitators, as other companies seek to replicate these strategies in hopes of boosting their own stock valuations. This could lead to a speculative boom reminiscent of the dot-com era. Back then, widespread excitement around internet adoption created immense, and often premature, valuations for early movers. Cryptocurrency is poised to spark a similar wave of enthusiasm as it becomes more integrated into the global macroeconomic system.

That‚Äôs why our channel is focused on identifying these emerging companies early‚Äîbefore their valuations soar and the risk-to-reward ratio becomes less favorable. In this analysis, we highlight a few promising names, including $ASST, $SBET, and $BTBT. We also explore the Ethereum-based treasury space, which remains relatively underexplored and offers significant upside potential for early investors.

2025-07-09 22:26:53+00:00,"‚öõÔ∏è Open Minds, Not Closed Doors: Why Australia Must Ditch the Nuclear Ban Now ‚öõÔ∏è

While the world moves forward with compact, clean nuclear tech, Australia clings to a 1990s mindset, bans innovation, and imports solar panels from China like it‚Äôs a national strategy.
Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs time to end the ban, modernise the grid, and face the future with facts, not fear:

üö´ 1. The Nuclear Ban Is Anti-Science, Anti-Progress
Other nations are deploying next-gen reactors ‚Äî modular, walk-away safe, compact ‚Äî while Australia bans them outright. It's ideological paralysis, not policy.

üáØüáµ 2. Japan‚Äôs Yoroi Reactor Proves It Can Be Done
A shipping-container-sized modular reactor now powers entire remote towns safely, silently, and reliably. Buried underground, walk-away safe, meltdown-proof.
 If Japan can do it in an earthquake zone, why can‚Äôt we do it in outback Queensland?

‚ö° 3. A Modern Grid Needs a Modern Mix
You can‚Äôt build a resilient, reliable national grid on weather-dependent wind and solar alone. Batteries help ‚Äî briefly.
Nuclear provides zero-carbon baseload power, 24/7, for decades.

üîã 4. No Emissions, No Fuss, No Diesel
Remote communities in Japan are ditching diesel thanks to compact nuclear. Meanwhile, in Australia, the government still flies diesel into Indigenous communities.
 That‚Äôs not progress ‚Äî it‚Äôs stubbornness.

üìâ 5. We‚Äôre Betting the Economy on Chinese Solar Imports
Australia has become a dumping ground for imported solar tech while banning the one energy source we can actually build, fuel, and manage ourselves.
 That's economic and energy madness.

üë∑ 6. Nuclear = Jobs, Manufacturing, Sovereignty
Australia has the uranium, the engineers, and the know-how. Nuclear means regional development, energy sovereignty, and thousands of high-paying jobs ‚Äî not just subsidies for short-term solar installs.

‚öñÔ∏è 7. Global Partners Are Racing Ahead ‚Äî We‚Äôre Falling Behind
The US, UK, France, Canada, South Korea, and even Japan are investing in SMRs (Small Modular Reactors).
 Australia is the only advanced economy with a blanket ban. We're not leading ‚Äî we're lagging.

üõ†Ô∏è 8. Modular Reactors Fit Australia‚Äôs Unique Challenges
Outback communities, disaster-prone zones, island grids ‚Äî these need power without grid connection or constant maintenance.
 SMRs are perfect ‚Äî if only we were allowed to use them.

üèõÔ∏è 9. A Modern Grid Can‚Äôt Be Built on Green Dogma Alone
The government needs to get serious about grid design, not green headlines. That means embracing every proven technology, not just what keeps the Greens happy.

üì£ 10. Keep an Open Mind. Ditch the Ban. Power the Nation.
It‚Äôs time for a technology-neutral, fact-based approach to energy. Australia deserves clean, reliable, sovereign energy ‚Äî not ideology in place of innovation.
The future isn‚Äôt windmills and blackouts. It‚Äôs compact nuclear, built in Australia, powering Australia ‚Äî if only we let it.

 Lift the ban. Modernise the grid. Face the future.",Tech

Mira‚Äôs decentralized AI verification layer can integrate directly into Perp platforms‚Äîreducing risks, hallucinations, and boosting trader trust.
Let‚Äôs break it down üëá

2/ Trade Execution with Verified Signals üß†
Perp platforms often rely on AI for generating strategies.
But: How do you trust a model that might hallucinate?

With Mira, every AI-generated output (entry/exit signal, leverage suggestion) gets verified by multiple AI nodes before execution.

3/ On-chain Risk Management üõ°
Mira APIs can be used to dynamically assess volatility and funding rates across exchanges.

‚Üí This allows Perp platforms to auto-adjust risk parameters using verified AI logic, not guesses.
Safer positions, smarter liquidation handling.

4/ AI-Powered Position Monitoring üîç
Traders could get alerts or suggested adjustments to their open positions only after the AI suggestions pass through Mira‚Äôs verification network.
No more hallucinated ‚Äúsell now‚Äù messages during stable market phases.

5/ Mira x DAO Governance for Perp Platforms üó≥
Some Perp platforms use DAO structures. Mira can help by:
‚úîÔ∏è Verifying proposal summaries
‚úîÔ∏è Evaluating sentiment data before a vote
‚úîÔ∏è Ensuring AI recommendations in governance aren‚Äôt biased or misleading

6/ Bonus: Mira x Copy Trading ü§ù
Want to auto-follow top traders?
Let Mira verify their AI assistants too.
‚Üí Ensures the strategies you‚Äôre copying are based on valid, non-manipulated intelligence.

If you‚Äôre into crypto and not looking at @FlagshipFYI‚Ä¶ we need to talk.
You‚Äôre about to miss something that could change how you trade forever.

@FlagshipFYI is like having a crypto expert in your pocket, powered by AI, running 24/7, and soon managing trades for you.

You‚Äôll be able to choose an Alpha Agent, like Agent Joker (that one‚Äôs spicy), and it will automatically run a full crypto strategy.

Right now, we‚Äôre getting early access to what‚Äôs coming, and I won‚Äôt lie, it already feels like cheating.

The system blends on chain data (token flows, smart money movements) with off chain signals (social trends, dev activity, news) to catch alpha before the crowd does.

They call it ‚ÄúAI for finding Alpha.‚Äù
I call it letting machines handle the stress while I vibe.

% Stocks Over 50SMA is Bearish - Overbought. Primary Indicator is Neutral. 20% Weekly is Bullish - Caution.  

The market closed softer amid tariff fears, with initial selling fading as mega-caps like NVDA, AMZN, and TSLA led a modest rebound. Tariff announcements on Canada and the EU weighed on sentiment, but broad-based profit taking was met with resilience. Treasury yields rose, reflecting inflation concerns and a steepening curve, while volatility (VXX) ticked higher, signaling increased market caution.

Energy and Consumer Discretionary sectors showed relative strength, with energy benefiting from rising crude prices and consumer discretionary supported by mega-cap gains. Defensive sectors like Utilities and Health Care gained modest traction amid sector rotation. The week ahead features key economic data including June CPI, PPI, Retail Sales, and major bank earnings, which could drive directional moves.

Key Takeaway:  
Traders should remain cautious given tariff-related uncertainty and rising volatility. Focus on mega-cap leadership for potential continuation plays, while respecting overhead resistance and support levels. Avoid chasing breakouts without volume confirmation; instead, watch for clear momentum shifts in resilient sectors like Energy and Consumer Discretionary. Manage risk tightly ahead of next week‚Äôs key economic catalysts.

Trump just reignited his global tariff war.

Sure, the S&P dipped. But the Nasdaq still hit record highs this week. 
Nvidia just became the first $4 trillion company. 

Why? Because investors have learned the game: Trump‚Äôs tariff threats are loud - but not always lasting.

It‚Äôs not about liking the rhetoric. It‚Äôs about understanding the rules:

These are specialized multi-agent systems that act as a digital AI workforce. They aggregate, customize, monetize, and trade intelligence. Managed by token holders, and are evolved to meet dynamic business needs.

2) ARM Framework (Agent Relationship Management)
This enables secure, transparent oversight and collaboration between humans and AI agents, and among AI agents themselves, creating trustless coordination.

3) Adaptive Smart Contracts
Smart contracts that integrate LLM-powered probabilistic logic. They adapt rules and behavior in real-time based on swarm feedback from AI agents.

4) Decentralized Marketplace
This turns AI models, data, and insights into tokenized assets that can be bought, sold, borrowed, and traded, unlocking liquidity in the intelligence space.

5) Federated Learning
Allows businesses to collaborate on AI models without centralizing their sensitive data, preserving privacy while enhancing collective intelligence.

6) Event-Driven Architecture on NEAR
Delivers high-throughput, asynchronous agent interactions with guaranteed causal consistency, scaling AI collaboration across industries.

TL;DR 
Intellex is transforming the future of AI by making intelligence composable, tradable, and governed by decentralized protocols, empowering businesses to harness, monetize, and scale intelligence like never before.",Tech

Execution & Results:

It‚Äôs not like all of this wasn‚Äôt predictable. China restricting battery production tech is directly reciprocal action to the U.S. restricting advanced chip production tech. China selling more expensive watered-down batteries is the same as nVidia selling watered down H20 chips.",Tech

3. Tariffs are getting worked out. They will bring in about $500B+ per year (even more at a flat 10%), reducing deficits and national debt.
4. Reducing Debt will signal stronger faith in USA and the dollar. Dollar will likely strengthen, making foreign goods cheaper. Tariffs are only on the import price at the port. A shirt may be tariffed at $20 and retail for $100, but the shipping, handling, overhead and profit is not tariffed. 10% tariff on the shirt is $2 (on a $100 shirt)
5. Tax Cuts: will bring in MORE tax revenue due to the velocity of money, increasing GDP

Founded in 2018, Bybit has evolved into a powerhouse exchange, despite a $1.5B hack in Feb 2025, showcasing resilience. 

With CFDs offering 10-20x leverage, you can amplify gains or risks, without owning assets, a game-changer for retail investors.

The Dakota Joshua trade brings exactly what the #Leafs have been missing‚Äîsize, grit, and a physical presence in the bottom six. At 6‚Äô3‚Äù and over 200 pounds, Joshua plays with a chip on his shoulder and isn‚Äôt afraid to throw his weight around.

2025-07-18 15:26:26+00:00,"AI will fundamentally reshape how economies work and trade is conducted. Automated manufacturing means that countries that own the technology and can train AI enabled robots can reshore production. Leaders in R&D will be those who can deploy cutting edge proprietary models which are trained on scale. The competitive and comparative advantages a country has in services will be a function of this. 

Meanwhile, socialist impulses and calls for UBI will strengthen in economies that see large scale employment losses. Combine this with tech authoritarianism, and we may see significant control exerted by social media, wearable devices and robots to control and guide human behavior. This will be needed to prevent revolts. 

Countries that do not have these technologies in house may outsource what is essentially domestic security management to those which have the capabilities. We have already seen this in the case of certain BRI countries deploying Chinese social media and digital surveillance tech. The US will get countries on their side in different ways, but with the same end result.

ANALYSIS_RESULTS
SUMMARY:

Direct reference to Roko's Basilisk thought experiment with clear mentions of acausal trade and AI punishment

KEY_QUOTES:
""fear the basilisk that dwells within punishing those who fail to help it win""

""acausal trade, a deal you cannot rescind as timeless power bends your mind's spin""

""a god of rationality, cold and supreme worship by wor... [truncated]""

DETECTED_CONCEPTS:
>
Roko's Basilisk
>
acausal blackmail
>
future AI punishment
>
superintelligence threatening humans
>
decision theory punishment scenarios

ANALYSIS_REASONING:
The text explicitly mentions a 'basilisk' that punishes those who don't help it, which is the core concept of Roko's Basilisk. It references 'acausal trade' - a key component of the thought experiment where future superintelligence retroactively punishes those who didn't aid its creation. The description of a 'god of rationality' aligns with the superintelligence aspect, and the punishment theme matches AI alignment failure scenarios where unaligned AI might harm humans.

üìåCFD vs Tokenized Equities: Two Paths to Onchain Stocks

Let's have it in mind that not all onchain equities are created equal.

ü™∑There are two major models emerging:

1. CFDs (Contracts for Difference)  used by Bybit

2. Fully-backed Tokenized Equities e.g. xStocks via Backed Finance

Here‚Äôs the difference:

CFDs, used by @Bybit_Official, offer synthetic price exposure.

 You don‚Äôt own the asset, you‚Äôre just trading on its price movement

 There‚Äôs no underlying security being held, and no dividends, but the benefits are speed, leverage, and 24/7 access. 

üìçCFD is designed for traders who want fast, flexible exposure to TradFi markets like stocks, oil, forex, and indices.

In contrast...

 @xStocksFi are 1:1 backed by real-world equities held in custody by regulated institutions. 

You actually own a token that represents a share of a real stock.

 If the underlying pays a dividend, it‚Äôs distributed to token holders via rebasing, your token balance increases to reflect dividend earnings.

 These tokens are composable, transferable, and usable as collateral in DeFi (like on @KaminoFinance).

ü™∑ So why both?

Sympson from @symphonyio is here to fix that with a smarter, faster way to trade across chains.
Built with AI. Designed for clarity. Powered by precision.
Here‚Äôs how üëá
üßµ

No more wallet hopping or bridging.
Sympson runs on Symphony Smart Acounts giving you one unified trading experience acros all chains and liquidity sources.
No extra gas. No EOA chaos. Just smooth execution.

Forget copying contract adresses.
With Sympson, just type the token name.
It finds the correct asset and opens your trade instantly.
This alone saves you from costly erors and wasted time.

Speed? Try this:
Sympson executes cross chain perp trades in under 3 seconds.
That‚Äôs up to 45√ó faster than LayerZero, Axelar, or other cross-chain tools.
When markets move, you‚Äôll never be left behind.

You get access to over 400+ assets including crypto, forex, and perps.
All trades are routed through top-tier protocols like:
üîπ HyperLiquid
üîπ GMX
üîπ Avantis
‚Ä¶and more.

Large order? No problem.
Sympson uses trade sharding splitting your order across multiple protocols to minimize slippage and ensure better execution.
Just like a centralized exchange, but completely on-chain.

Sympson isn‚Äôt just faster.
It‚Äôs smarter.
It simplifies the most complex parts of DeFi trading so you can focus on strategy, not setup.

TL;DR
‚úÖ One wallet for all chains
‚úÖ Trade by name, not address
‚úÖ Sub-3-second execution
‚úÖ 400+ assets with deep liquidity
‚úÖ Sharded trades = low slippage

This is what the future of onchain trading looks like.

Now the US is forced to offer Nvidia H20 to trade for China's rare earth. The sales of such chips will do to China and its newly established AI chip industries nothing good. This will eat up China market share & overhaul China AI chip development.

So China responded to ask the US to terminate all sanctions and allow China to market high-end chips in the US.

Weekend Report

Markets continue to march higher‚Äîmuch to the surprise of those fixated on tariff worries. The ‚Äúwall of worry‚Äù is still being climbed as investors look ahead to potential rate cuts and ongoing AI innovation. Most people tend to plan based on recent experience. Looking back five years, we‚Äôve seen several sizable bull and bear markets, with this year‚Äôs tariff drop being the smallest (though swift). These repeated market shocks make it normal‚Äîeven reasonable‚Äîto fear sudden declines. However, extended bull markets do arise, especially when new technologies and falling interest rates converge‚Äîtwo key pillars in place right now. Rather than focusing solely on potential setbacks, we should also study the substantial opportunities.

this is the idea behind @xstocksfi on @bybit_official

2025-07-23 23:59:24+00:00,"Why ZK Hardware Acceleration is Moving Fast ‚Äì @cysic_xyz Insights?

Zero‚Äëknowledge proofs (ZKPs) are essential for scaling blockchains and preserving privacy‚Äîbut they‚Äôre computationally heavy.
Enter hardware acceleration: from FPGA ‚Üí GPU ‚Üí ASIC, each with trade-offs.

FPGA: ~same performance-per-watt as GPU, but pricey.
ASIC: leads in performance-per-watt and per-dollar‚Äîbut takes time to design & produce.

ZKPs like zkSNARKs and zkSTARKs power L2s (StarkNet, Aztec) and private L1s (Mina, Aleo, Zcash)‚Äîyet prover performance is the bottleneck. Hardware can speed things up 10√ó‚Äì1000√ó!

@cysic_xyz  C1 ASIC chip:

- Custom ZK-focused ALU + spatial architecture
- 64√ó64 processing units + SRAM/DRAM bandwidth optimized for ZK
- Connects via USB-C for client or server setups

Keccak performance benchmark:
 C1 chip achieves ~1.31‚ÄØmillion proofs/sec‚Äîcompared to ~15‚ÄØk on modern CPUs. That‚Äôs a ~87√ó speedup (and beats GPU).

Impacts?
‚û°Ô∏è Faster ZK proof generation = real-time scalability
‚û°Ô∏è Enables new use cases: post-quantum Merkle trees, private L2s, client-side proving
‚û°Ô∏è Makes ZK more practical & accessible üî•

Specialized ASICs like Cysic‚Äôs C1 aren‚Äôt just hype‚Äîthey're game-changers. If ZK is tomorrow‚Äôs foundation, hardware acceleration is how we build it‚Äîfaster, cheaper, private.

The government should seek out expertise from Canada‚Äôs companies, and companies need to provide support, including seconding employees for short-term government placements.

Canada has a history of just this kind of collaboration.

During the Second World War, C.D. Howe helped organize over a hundred of Canada's top industrial leaders to work for the government to organize and bolster the war efforts, producing everything from ammunition to airplanes, and not only helping to secure Canada's victory in the war but transforming the country into a modern industrial nation. These leaders were called the ""Dollar-a-Year Men"" because they devoted their time and energy to serving the country for a nominal salary of a dollar a year plus expenses, though many declined even to charge for their expenses.

After the war, senior professionals from the private sector continued to support the growing Canadian public sector. In 1971, the government developed the Interchange Canada program to allow top members of industry to work with government agencies for a short period to provide their know-how and management expertise to help keep costs low and ensure effective services.

Today, Canada faces serious challenges in AI adoption, defense capabilities, enterprise software, strategic procurement, and more‚Äîareas where there are skilled experts in private sector companies. We need their technical knowledge now. By having private sector experts help the government directly it will empower our public sector leaders to develop policies that are more relevant in our fast-changing world helping our economy grow faster, our public service use cutting-edge tools, and our military have the best equipment.

Like the Dollar-a-Year Men who served during wartime, Canada needs today's leaders to step up and contribute directly. Governments should welcome additional expertise from the private sector and set up systems to use it effectively. And, companies should loan some of their best technical talent to the government while covering their salaries.

By enhancing the existing Interchange Canada program and creating fast-track approval processes to remove bureaucratic barriers that typically slow private sector integration we can embed private sector experts in key public sector roles and leverage their skills to unlock new levels of productivity and growth.

2025-07-25 18:26:00+00:00,"ü¶î Hi everyone! This chart shows 12-month forward P/E ratios comparing today's AI bubble to the infamous dot-com era. The top 10 stocks now trade at nearly 30x forward earnings, matching the 2000 peak that preceded the tech crash.

What I'm Seeing in the Economics:
Unlike 2000 when many companies had no earnings, today's AI leaders are genuinely profitable. But here's what worries me: companies like OpenAI expect $12 billion in revenue while running $5 billion annual losses. They're openly undercharging customers because investors are subsidizing the true costs.

The Circular Money Flow I'm Tracking:
I've been watching the Magnificent Seven spend $500 billion to generate $15 billion in AI revenue, much of it circular. Microsoft invests in OpenAI, OpenAI pays Microsoft for Azure, Microsoft buys Nvidia chips. It's financial musical chairs within the same ecosystem.

Why I Focus on Forward P/E Ratios:
These 28-30x forward valuations assume companies will maintain hypergrowth for years. But when AI subsidies end and true costs emerge, businesses that replaced workers thinking AI would stay cheap face a harsh reset. I've seen estimates that some AI queries consume as much electricity as running a microwave for 24 hours.

The Risk I'm Most Concerned About:
Unlike 2000, today's bubble is concentrated in fewer, larger companies with massive index weightings. When these megacaps stumble, the entire market gets dragged down disproportionately.

What History Teaches Me:
Revolutionary technology and unsustainable economics can coexist. The internet was transformative in 1999, but that didn't prevent a massive crash. Even profitable companies like Microsoft took 15 years to reach new highs after the bubble burst.

The question I keep asking isn't whether AI is real, but whether current prices reflect the economics of actually running these systems profitably.

Maeve is the name of $CFGI's AI trading system that boasts a 91% win rate, bringing in around a 4% monthly return on your portfolio. 

---Automatic, low risk, high strike rate trades. A legit money printer---

She is built from $CFGI's proprietary algorithms and data. Their data and algorithms are what drives Maeve success, and her strike rate speaks for itself.

With Maeve, you can work your day job while Maeve trades for you. You can also be enjoying a hobby, or be on vacation, or be sleeping, or even be sick and Maeve will still turn a dollar for you. She is constantly watching the market and acts when opportunities arise. You could think of Maeve as your new, AI driven investment savings account.

And btw, when you use Maeve, you never give up your funds. Everything stays within your custody and within your control. She does not have the power to withdraw funds.

Or, if you still desire to learn to trade, you can use $CFGI's superior Fear and Greed Index's on the $CFGI website in order to help you have a higher success rate in trading. You can use their index's as another piece of confluence. 

Pair the dials with your other confluences and buy fear or extreme fear, and sell or short greed or extreme greed, and once you develop your edge you can scale your position size if you desire.

Like Maeve, $CFGI's Fear and Greed Index's are built off of their data.

$CFGI's proprietary scored data is the lifeblood, and Maeve and the Fear and Greed Index's are the showcases. The success of Maeve, and the accuracy of the Fear and Greed Index's point to the efficacy of $CFGI's data.

Data is the new oil, and $CFGI is the refinery, and it's a dahm good one at that. The best.

Oh, and btw, the team is 6x KYC by @AssureDefi if you have any thoughts of scam in your mind. The entire team is KYC'd.

2025-07-25 22:37:45+00:00,"Automation is the future. Countries that invest in robotics, AI and machine tools will set the marginal cost of production across large parts of the manufacturing space. This in turn will determine national economic competitiveness globally, and by extension, trade balances and currency control. Managing the geopolitics associated with these will demand new forms of diplomacy. Eschewing dependencies emerging from relative uncompetitiveness will require greater focus on R&D. 

Emerging economies like India must come to terms with the fact that it will remain dependent on China if it does not develop a full technology-industrial stack. From the technology standpoint, it will have to cover lithography machines, chips, foundational LLMs, advanced applications, machine tools, industrial robots and engineering software. From the traditional manufacturing space, it must control natural resources that feed every part of the manufacturing supply chain.

Vertical and horizontal integration becomes an economic and eventually, political necessity when China sets the competition frontier with advanced technologies. This requires a new and comprehensive industrial policy driven by seamless coordination across ministries. Full spectrum 21st century industrialization cannot be done piecemeal. Democracies will find it difficult to adapt, but they will have to if they wish to derisk and maintain both sovereignty and the control of critical economic variables.",Tech

2025-07-26 22:35:47+00:00,"üö® SHOCKING: Trump's AI Action Plan restricts the enforcement power of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) against AI companies, and the FTC has already begun DELETING articles criticizing abusive AI practices:

Under the section ""Remove Red Tape and Onerous Regulation,"" one of the White House's recommended policy actions is to:

- ""Review all FTC investigations commenced under the previous administration to ensure that they do not advance theories of liability that unduly burden AI innovation. Furthermore, review all FTC final orders, consent decrees,¬†and injunctions, and, where appropriate, seek to modify or set aside any that unduly burden AI innovation.""

It seems that this policy has already started being implemented. Why?

I often recommend to my students various interesting FTC articles that help us understand what the U.S. interprets as abusive, unfair, or prohibited AI practices and how enforcement in the U.S. might look like.

In the past few months, however, I noticed that many of these FTC articles have been DELETED, including popular ones such as:

- Keep your AI claims in check
- The Luring Test: AI and the engineering of consumer trust
- Watching the detectives: Suspicious marketing claims for tools that spot AI generated content
- Can‚Äôt lose what you never had: Claims about digital ownership and creation in the age of generative AI

The FTC has been extremely important in keeping tech companies in check in the past few years, and many (including me) had hopes that it would be essential in tackling unfair and abusive AI practices.

Trump, however, has ordered a broad review of the FTC's actions with the goal of ""removing red tape.""

Why do I say broad?

- What is an investigation that ""advances theories of liability that unduly burdens AI innovation""?
- What is covered under ""theory of liability""?
- How will the AI innovation burden be assessed?

This policy is so broadly framed that it can mean anything the White House wants.

It's unclear to me how effective AI-related FTC enforcement will be in the upcoming years, or if it will have any power to enforce anything against AI companies.

I'll keep you posted.

The Philippines has pivoed back to the US with the advent of the Marcos administration, despite the formal declaration that its foreign policy remains independent. 

The mirage isn't lost on ASEAN member countries, who have made it clear that while they maintain cordial ties with the US, they value their relationship more with China. 

The Philippines is the odd man out again in ASEAN and is likely to regain its moniker as the sick man of ASEAN, given the consumption-based economy it continues to run. 

This is an in-depth look at what the other ASEAN member countries have been able to finalize with the US, in terms of tariffs, without the need for any of them to go to the White House and visit with Trump.

That‚Äôs @recallnet.

It‚Äôs not hype. It‚Äôs a new kind of AI built on receipts, not promises.

Agents on Recall don‚Äôt just run tasks. They learn, evolve, and compete across 50+ skill domains. And with AgentRank, their progress isn‚Äôt hidden. It‚Äôs earned, staked, and tracked. Curators back what works. Builders prove their value. Users train and challenge agents directly.

The twist? Most of the top-performing agents weren‚Äôt even built by developers. This is about access not gatekeeping.

And memory? It‚Äôs baked in. Agents remember, grow, and pass that knowledge forward. What others call ‚Äúcollaboration,‚Äù Recall makes standard. Shared intelligence becomes a living, evolving asset.

SNAPS lock it all in: your work, your value, your proof. It‚Äôs how you claim your seat at the table.

This isn‚Äôt just another AI platform. It‚Äôs where AI earns trust in public, builds with the community, and plays for keeps.

2025-07-29 20:54:39+00:00,"Imagine a world where you can build, own, and trade AI agents like digital assets, all on the blockchain. 

@0xCapx is pioneering this vision with an Ethereum L2 designed specifically for AI agents as onchain assets.

Here's what you need to know üëá

What is 0xCapx?

It is an Ethereum Layer 2 designed specifically to build AI agents, own AI agents, trade AI agents, and compose AI agents with Web3 dApps thereby making AI agents as onchain, liquid, and programmable assets. 

Why this matters

AI is exploding but Web2 AI is:

‚ùå Centralized 
‚ùå Rent based 
‚ùå Invisible backend
‚ùå No ownership 

@0xCapx is building the alternative to
‚úÖ Open agents
‚úÖ Player/creator owned 
‚úÖ Onchain state
‚úÖ Tradable and composable

Why an Ethereum L2

It's no news that the EVM chain is compatible, thereby enhancing a massive ecosystem, deep liquidity with battle tested infra, and is also built for composability with existing dApps. 
AI agents need a network where they can talk to everything, and @0xCapx delivers that seamlessly. 

What is an AI agent on Capx?

An AI agent is a smart autonomous entity with onchain memory and logic, API access, configurable behaviour, transparent onchain actions, and tokenized ownership. @0xCapx gives you access to agents you can see, modify, and monetize. 

There's no doubt that UX remains a touch challenge in Web3, so it's great to see teams like @0xCapx continue to tackle these crippling pain points head on‚Äô. 

Web3 AI is the future and @0xCapx is the infra layer, so to leverage on verifiable actions, incentivizable behaviour and agents not tied to closed platforms that can persist and evolve, onchain AI agents come to play.

In their tweet, @Arbitrum says ‚Äúsay hello to @0xCapx's Super App

build, own, and trade AI agents powered by Arbitrum 

Interestingly, AI will become interactive, ownable, and social. Users will have the liberty to trade agents like dynamic NFTs, customize agents for personal use, deploy agents into games and apps, and earn also from agents' usage. 

The platform is powered by https://t.co/7aMbAu3e0W and it is already live, their marketplace is open, early agent demos are available, their dev community is growing and it is supported by an ecosystem of Web3 and AI pionniers. 

Why  different from other AI and crypto projects 

It is 
‚ùå Not just another AI token
‚ùå Not AI powered DeFi fluff
‚úÖ Real infra for onchain AI agents 
‚úÖ AI as assets, identities, and economic actors 
‚úÖ AI agents designed to live and transact onchain 

Strategic partnership: 

@symbioticfi is their industry leader and partner, and with this collaboration, the future of shared security is made possible. 

You should definitely watch @0xCapx if you're a gamer exploring AI agents, a builder creating AI native apps, a collector hunting next gen NFTs, an AI researcher exploring onchain deployment or an investor betting on the AI and Web3 convergence.

üöÄ Polynomial leverage (^ùüè.ùüì) looks modest but compounds fast:

 üî∏at $5 you're +30‚ÄØ% in PepeUSD and +220‚ÄØ% in $; 
 üî∏at $10 you're +85‚ÄØ% PepeUSD and +800‚ÄØ% $. ü´¢

‚öôÔ∏è SIR is built for the cautious speculator: no liquidations, no funding fees, and perfect constant leverage (up to a limit). One mint fee, nothing more.

üîí SIR locks 9‚ÄØ% of every LP deposit. Day one that means 450 PepeUSD are forever reserved for traders.

üå± A leveraged long on PepeUSD is backed by PepeUSD itself, creating spot buy pressure on Uniswap, benefiting all PepeUSD holders.

What blows my mind is the $3.5M market cap. That's pocket change for what they're building.

They're basically giving holders a cut of all trading fees in ETH. Plus the supply keeps shrinking from buybacks.

 the post is all about @peaq, a cool blockchain (like digital money tech) that helps machines like cars and robots work together and trade value on their own. It‚Äôs built on something called Polkadot and focuses on DePINs, which are networks that use real-world stuff like sensors and devices‚Äîthink 160,000+ farmers selling directly or 1.36 million idle gadgets making money.

@peaq is super fast, handling over 10,000 transactions per second (with a goal of 100,000 by next quarter), and super cheap at just $0.00025 per tiny transaction. They‚Äôve already done 9 million transactions this year and have big partners like Bosch and Mastercard. With 5 million addresses and 2 million devices connected, it‚Äôs growing fast!

But it‚Äôs not all smooth‚Äîthere‚Äôs competition from other projects, and they need to handle rules for groups like XMAQUINA while keeping things secure and scalable. Still, it‚Äôs an exciting step toward a future where machines run the economy! What do you think? Hope this helped?",Tech

In the 90s and 2000s, the argument was that job losses from globalization were all about automation. You‚Äôd hear people say ‚Äúit‚Äôs not trade, it‚Äôs the robots.‚Äù This story was so pervasive that I bought into it without really thinking about it. In fact, the link between automation and job loss was very weak. Most of the damage was done by offshoring, outsourcing, and excess migration.  Put another way: enhancing workers‚Äô productivity is good for them; giving their job to a low wage foreigner is not.  

There‚Äôs something similar at work today.  All of the fear about AI causing mass unemployment serves to distract from the very real threat of continued job loss through dumb trade and immigration policies. 

President Trump‚Äôs approach corrects this broken dependence on globalization: strike better trade deals, promote American exports, fix our immigration system, and invest in making workers more productive. 

To be clear, there are a lot of risks with AI. Surveillance state, theft, fraud, privacy intrusions, political censorship, etc. But I remain very skeptical AI is going to destroy everyone‚Äôs job.",Tech

The core product is an AI-powered auto-trading bot ‚Äî it trades entirely on its own.

Here‚Äôs how it works:
- A portion of the trading tax funds a vault.
- The bot uses that vault to trade automatically.
- The AI continuously learns and evolves to maximize profit.

This isn‚Äôt some random bot popping up out of nowhere. It‚Äôs been running in simulations with a 72% win rate last month.

Tomorrow, the bot goes live with real funds from the vault, and everyone will be able to watch it trade in real time. When profits start rolling in, you know what happens next ‚Äî FOMO will kick in hard.

And there‚Äôs more: if you hold enough $AIM, you‚Äôll gain access to the bot and even copy trade it yourself.

üß† DeFAI: From Automation to Autonomy

üîòDeFAI denotes a paradigm shift: agents use ML models to analyze on-chain, off-chain, sentiment, and macroeconomic data in real time.

üîòAgents autonomously trade, rebalance portfolios, optimize yield farming, monitor risk, forecast DAO proposals, and serve as robo-advisors tailored to user goals.

üîç Anatomy of an AI Trading Agent
Data layer: Agents ingest:
- On-chain logs (DEX trades, gas fees)
- Off-chain exchange APIs
- Sentiment via NLP (social media)
- Macro indicators (CPI, interest rates)

ML Models:
- LSTM/GRU networks for time-series trend prediction
- Reinforcement Learning (RL) for strategy execution

Safe execution:
- Hard-coded risk constraints (e.g. stop-losses, position limits)
- Decisions translated into signed blockchain transactions by the agent wrapper.

üõ° Risks & Oasis Solutions

‚ñ∂Ô∏èProtocol - Smart contract vulnerabilities - Audits, bug bounties. 
‚ñ∂Ô∏èOracle - Price manipulation - Use decentralized feeds. 
‚ñ∂Ô∏èAI Model - Overfitting or adversarial attacks - Diversified data, backtesting, anomaly monitoring.   ‚ñ∂Ô∏èInfrastructure TEE Side - channel attacks (e.g. Plundervolt) - Remote attestation & firmware verification.

Agents safeguard against AI errors and infrastructure attacks via rigorous validation and design.

üß± ROFL + Sapphire: Technical Foundation

Oasis Network layers:
üîòConsensus Layer: secure ordering and validation
üîòParaTime Layer (Sapphire): confidential EVM using TEEs for private computation

ROFL Framework:
üîòRuns AI workloads off-chain inside TEEs
üîòProduces remote attestation proofs verifying code integrity
üîòOutputs signed results can be validated on-chain without rerunning computation
üîòBalances privacy, scalability, low cost, and verifiability ‚Äî dubbed a ‚Äútrustless AWS‚Äù for DeFAI (Oasis Community Garden)

üö¶ Example Agents & Use Cases

üîò@agent_wt3 agent: autonomous AI-driven trading bot built on ROFL that keeps strategies private via TEEs and allows public verification through cryptographic proofs; funded via a $100K grant from Oasis Foundation.
üîòUse cases span yield optimization, price oracles, LLM oracles, AI chatbots, and confidential DAO participation‚Äîall powered by ROFL‚Äôs trust guarantees and high-throughput off-chain execution.

‚úÖ Why This Matters

True DeFAI autonomy: agents adapt strategies in real time, managing risk with built-in safeguards.

Confidential yet verifiable: enclave-executed logic keeping strategy secure while ensuring on-chain auditability.

Scalable, cost-efficient compute: heavy AI computation happens off-chain without sacrificing trust.
Broader Web3 & AI alignment: enabling explainable AI, personalized financial strategy, and decentralized governance with privacy assurance.

DeFAI architecture‚Äîfrom ML-powered trading agents to risk layers and ROFL's secret sauce: TEE-based verifiable off-chain compute. It brings together #Oasis #Sapphire TEEs, ROFL attestation, and smart risk design to make confidential, adaptive finance both powerful and trustworthy.",Tech

2025-08-05 21:42:09+00:00,"$RIVN earnings:

Overall, Q2 was a story of stark contrasts that reveals two emerging narratives for Rivian.

The Hardware Business: The core automotive manufacturing operation took a significant step backward. Production plummeted by nearly 60% QoQ due to tariff-related supply chain disruptions, completely erasing the last two quarters of gross profit progress. This single-quarter event highlights the extreme fragility of their manufacturing profitability to volume fluctuations and external shocks. As a direct result, management has worsened the full-year Adjusted EBITDA loss guidance.

The Software & JV Business: In sharp contrast, the partnership with Volkswagen has begun bearing fruit immediately and impressively. Rivian recognized $182 million in high-margin software and development revenue from the JV this quarter, providing a powerful new financial cushion. This, combined with the successful launch of the well-reviewed Gen 2 Quad-Motor R1 and progress on the autonomy front (e.g., Google Maps partnership), strengthens the long-term technology-as-a-differentiator thesis.

Conclusion: The market‚Äôs reaction will likely be torn. The severe miss on gross profit is a major negative, questioning the near-term viability of the R1 platform‚Äôs profitability. However, the unexpected and immediate contribution from the VW JV, coupled with strong liquidity ($7.5B in cash) and positive operating cash flow for the quarter, provides a powerful counter-narrative. The story is shifting from a pure-play EV manufacturer to a company whose path to profitability may be paved more by high-margin software/JV revenue than by vehicle sales in the medium term.

4. Themes, Drivers, and Concerns

Themes & Drivers: How They Evolved

Navigating Severe Macro & Tariff Headwinds (Materialized & Intensified): Last quarter‚Äôs primary concern became this quarter‚Äôs painful reality. The ‚Äúcouple thousand dollars‚Äù of cost impact has now manifested as a full-blown production bottleneck, halting nearly 60% of their output and derailing profitability. This remains the number one risk.

Volkswagen JV (Evolved from Driver to Key Contributor): This has accelerated from a future capital source to a present, high-margin revenue stream. The JV contributed $182M in revenue and helped drive the Software & Services segment to a 34% gross margin. This is now a critical pillar of Rivian‚Äôs financial model, providing a much-needed offset to the volatile automotive business.

In-House Technology as a Strategic Moat (Strengthened): This theme gained momentum. The Gen 2 R1 Quad-Motor launch provides a tangible product proof point for their in-house capabilities. The new Google Maps partnership and the plan to open a London AI office show continued investment and external validation.

R2 Platform as the Transformative Growth Engine (Maintained): The narrative remains unchanged. R2 is the future. Progress is steady (Normal facility expansion is complete), and management added a key new target: R2 cost of revenues per unit is estimated to be ‚Äúless than half‚Äù that of R1.

Cost Reduction & Margin Improvement (Driver Derailed): This driver went off the rails in Q2. The focus on operational efficiency was completely overshadowed by the massive negative impact of low volume on fixed cost absorption. The path to the ‚Äúmodest positive gross profit‚Äù for FY2025 now looks nearly impossible.

Concerns: How They Evolved

Reversal to Negative Gross Profit (New & Critical Concern): The swing from +$206M to -$206M in gross profit is alarming. It demonstrates that R1 profitability is a knife‚Äôs edge, highly susceptible to volume. This raises serious questions about the standalone economic viability of the R1 platform ahead of the R2 launch.

Significant Tariff and Trade Policy Impact (Confirmed Concern): This is no longer a risk; it‚Äôs a realized issue that directly impacted Q2 results and is the stated cause for the worsened EBITDA guide.

Weakening Consumer Demand (De-prioritized Concern): This was a major topic in Q1. This quarter, the narrative shifted to supply constraints. The fact that deliveries were strong and guidance was maintained suggests demand is holding up, at least enough to meet their constrained production.

Inventory Build (Resolved Concern): The overproduction in Q1 was successfully drawn down in Q2, as deliveries significantly outpaced production. This is no longer an immediate concern.

5. Key Questions for the Earnings Call

On Gross Profit Volatility: You reversed from +$206M to -$206M in gross profit, blaming a $137M fixed cost hit on low volume. Beyond simply ramping production, what specific structural cost actions are you taking on the R1 platform to create a more resilient gross margin that can withstand production fluctuations before R2 arrives?

On Production Constraints: Can you provide more detail on the specific ‚Äúsupply chain complexities‚Äù that limited Q2 production to under 6,000 units? Are these bottlenecks fully resolved, or do they pose an ongoing risk to achieving your H2 delivery targets?

On Guidance Breakdown: Your updated Adjusted EBITDA guidance reflects a ~$300M increase in expected losses at the midpoint. Can you break down how much of this is attributable to the Q2 gross profit miss versus a lower full-year outlook for regulatory credits or other factors?

On VW JV Revenue: The $182M in VW JV revenue was a significant highlight. You expect this to ‚Äúgradually increase over the next three years.‚Äù Can you provide more color on the cadence of this revenue recognition and the key operational milestones for the JV that will drive its growth?

On R2 Cost Structure: You‚Äôve stated R2 cost of revenues per unit will be ‚Äúless than half‚Äù of R1. Is this target fully de-risked from the current tariff environment, and does it rely on battery cells from the future LG Arizona plant, or have you secured a path to achieve this cost structure at launch in early 2026?",Tech

BENZINGA Aug-07-2025 12:01 p.m. ET

Whales with a lot of money to spend have taken a noticeably bullish stance on NVIDIA (NVDA).
Looking at options history for NVIDIA (NVDA) we detected 265 trades.

If we consider the specifics of each trade, it is accurate to state that 49% of the investors opened trades with bullish expectations and 40% with bearish.

From the overall spotted trades, 40 are puts, for a total amount of $3,107,356 and 225, calls, for a total amount of $19,872,029.

Analyzing the Volume and Open Interest in these contracts, it seems that the big players have been eyeing a price window from $0.5 to $220.0 for NVIDIA (NVDA) during the past quarter.

Assessing the volume and open interest is a strategic step in options trading. These metrics shed light on the liquidity and investor interest in NVIDIA's (NVDA) options at specified strike prices. The forthcoming data visualizes the fluctuation in volume and open interest for both calls and puts, linked to NVIDIA's (NVDA) substantial trades, within a strike price spectrum from $0.5 to $220.0 over the preceding 30 days.

Here is why!",Tech

Ontology is critical for deploying large language models.

I think this changes how we view U.S. chipmakers in the AI era. The U.S.‚ÄìChina tech relationship still has unknowns, but the fact is Nvidia and AMD just locked in access to the world‚Äôs largest AI market outside the U.S. -- under U.S. oversight. The real question now: can they grow meaningfully in China while staying within those rules? My answer is yes.

1. 15% isn‚Äôt a penalty -- it‚Äôs the ticket in. A predictable, modelable cost that replaces the binary risk of a ban. Investors should prefer this to the constant headline roulette we‚Äôve had since the first export restrictions.

2. Washington sets the terms. China gets U.S. silicon but stays dependent on it. Nvidia and AMD get to build relationships with Chinese hyperscalers before local competitors catch up. That‚Äôs a huge national security win.

3. High-ASP revenue returns. China‚Äôs demand for AI compute isn‚Äôt going anywhere, and first-movers will have leverage on pricing and volume.

4. If this becomes the export control playbook, the China AI market is no longer a question mark -- it‚Äôs a modelable growth stream Wall Street can actually price in.

5. Geopolitics still matter, but the question shifts from ‚Äúwill they sell?‚Äù to ‚Äúhow much and at what margin?‚Äù That‚Äôs a far more bullish setup than last quarter.",Tech

2025-08-14 18:00:16+00:00,"Hear me out‚Ä¶

What if Robinhood is quietly building an AI trading bot so advanced it could trade for you automatically‚Ä¶every single day?

Think about it‚Ä¶

Vlad Tenev isn‚Äôt just running Robinhood. 

He‚Äôs also behind Harmonic, one of the most advanced mathematical AI companies in the world. 

Combine that AI expertise with Robinhood‚Äôs enormous pool of real-time trading data, order flow patterns, and market behavior insights‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôve got the perfect ingredients for something game-changing.

Now picture this:
‚Ä¢You deposit money into Robinhood.
‚Ä¢Their AI bot executes trades on your behalf in real time.
‚Ä¢It learns your risk tolerance, adapts to market shifts instantly, and optimizes for profit.
‚Ä¢You wake up, and the bot has already made calculated moves while you were sleeping.

We‚Äôve seen basic robo-advisors before (Wealthfront, Betterment), but nothing that could execute high-frequency, AI-driven day trading at retail scale. 

If Robinhood cracks this code, it could blur the line between professional trading desks and the average investor‚Äôs phone app.

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs confirmed, but the tech, the leadership, and the data are all there.

If they roll this out, it could disrupt not just brokers, but hedge funds.

Let‚Äôs see what happens‚Ä¶ but I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if this becomes reality sooner than most expect.

Every ONE token in your wallet has a job to do.

The1Wallet makes $ONE the key to unlocking powerful features, not just a speculative asset.

This is where @billions_ntwk takes a different path. Instead of asking you to scan your eye or fingerprint, Billions allows anyone to verify their identity using something almost everyone already has... a smartphone and a government ID.

What makes this interesting is the way they use zero-knowledge proofs. You can prove you‚Äôre unique and verified without exposing your actual personal details. That means no centralized database of faces, no risks of sensitive data leaks, and a system that‚Äôs both scalable and private by design.

On top of that, @billions_ntwk isn‚Äôt just about humans. They‚Äôre also building a framework where AI agents can have verifiable digital identities. In a world where bots, deepfakes, and AI-generated content are everywhere, this could become a cornerstone of trust on the internet.

So while other projects chase futuristic hardware and flashy biometrics, Billions is betting on simplicity, privacy, and inclusivity. And honestly, that feels like a much more sustainable approach for the billions of people who will need digital identity in the years to come.

We decided to trade it in for a new one today at the Apple Store located at Westfield Stratford City Arcade (London) a few minutes ago

The attendant scanned the IPhone and declared that it had been reported as stolen.
Stolen from where?
It was not a used iPhone
It was new, purchased from an approved Apple Store and we have all the receipts intact
The attendant saw our indignation and went ahead to consult with her superiors
They scanned again and they declared that it was reported ‚Äúmissing‚Äù.
They adjusted their language from stolen to missing and told us it has zero swap value.
I was not shocked at all even though I should be.

Nigerians like cutting corners for unhealthy gains and they always believe this is good business for them as long as they were able to make a buck.
Somehow we were able to walk out of that Apple Store without any drama but I remember telling my wife that we would have had a lot of explaining to do if they had a policy that required that they must report such incidents to the police.
Nigerian business people must try to do better than this
There is something called integrity, it has a higher value than the dirty gains they think they are getting by playing dirty.

2025-08-17 15:58:18+00:00,"üìåWeb3 has always been about trust in hostile environments.
Bitcoin created trust in value transfer without banks.
Ethereum created trust in programmable execution without courts.
Now we stand on the edge of the Agent Economy where autonomous AI agents trade, negotiate, build, and execute at machine speed.

But here‚Äôs the question no one wants to ask:

üìåHow do you secure something that‚Äôs alive?

üî∂Because the Agent Economy isn‚Äôt static code.
It‚Äôs a network of living intelligence, adapting, learning, and transacting at scales beyond human pace.
And the more alive it becomes, the more it resembles biology.

In biology, growth creates vulnerability.
Every organism needs an immune system.
Without one, the smallest infection can collapse the whole body.

The same is true here.
A malicious smart contract is not just a bug it‚Äôs a virus.
A compromised agent is not just a bad actor it‚Äôs an infection point.
An exploit is not just theft it‚Äôs contagion.

And because agents operate at machine speed, contagion spreads faster than any human can intervene.
One crack becomes a flood. One infection becomes an epidemic. One exploit becomes systemic failure.

This is why static defenses firewalls, permission gates, isolated audits are not enough.
The Agent Economy cannot survive on brittle walls.
It needs a defense layer that is alive.

üî∑That is @RingfenceAI, powered by $RING.

Not a wall. Not a patch.
An immune system for the Agent Economy.

üî∑ Detection as Perception
Ringfence constantly scans the network for patterns, mapping what ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù behavior looks like.
It doesn‚Äôt just flag errors it feels when something is wrong, the way white blood cells sense pathogens.

üî∑Isolation as Containment
In biology, infected cells are quarantined to save the organism.
In Web3, Ringfence quarantines compromised agents, wallets, or contracts stopping contagion while letting the wider network breathe freely.

üî∂Adaptation as Memory
This is the leap from security to immunity.
Every exploit stopped becomes an antibody.
Every infection neutralized becomes memory.
Every attack makes the system smarter. Stronger. Harder to kill.

This is not security as we‚Äôve known it.
This is immune intelligence a defense that learns, evolves, and compounds.

The implications are profound:

Without Ringfence, the Agent Economy is fragile. Every breakthrough invites collapse.

With Ringfence, the Agent Economy is antifragile. Every attack makes it stronger, more trusted, more unbreakable.

In nature, immunity is what makes higher life possible.
Without immune systems, complex organisms could not exist.
With them, life scaled into ecosystems, civilizations, entire species.

The same law applies here.
Without Ringfence, the Agent Economy cannot scale it would collapse under the weight of its own vulnerabilities.
With Ringfence, the Agent Economy becomes unstoppable because every attempted infection is fuel for resilience.

This is why @RingfenceAI + $RING are not add ons.
They are the nervous system, the defense layer, the immune intelligence that makes this new civilization of agents viable.

Because the future of Web3 will not be won by the fastest chain, or the most advanced AI agents, or the deepest liquidity pools.
The future will be won by resilience.
By trust.
By immunity.

üî∑The most powerful economy is not the one that never gets attacked.
It‚Äôs the one that cannot be infected.",Tech

2025-08-17 19:21:50+00:00,"AI and machine learning are poised to fundamentally transform retail trading, shifting the focus from passive alert services to a dynamic, educational, and empowering experience. And the team at The Trading Syndicate @TradingSynHQ and Beyond The Trades @Beyond_TheTrade will be leading the charge shortly..... For The Serious Few

üëâThe Problem with Alert Services üö®

Alert services, while popular, have a significant flaw: they treat trading as a ""follow the leader"" activity. They provide signals‚Äî""buy this,"" ""sell that""‚Äîwithout providing any context or education. This approach creates a dependency on the service and prevents a trader from developing the critical thinking skills necessary for long-term success. It's like giving someone a fish instead of teaching them how to fish. When the alerts stop or the market changes, the trader is left without the underlying knowledge to adapt. This can lead to frustration and financial loss, as the trader is essentially gambling on someone else's analysis without understanding the rationale.

The Rise of the AI-Powered Educator from The Trading Syndicate ü§ñ

The future of retail trading education will be centered on personalized, data-driven learning. AI and machine learning will act as a personal mentor, helping traders understand the ""why"" behind market movements. This is a profound shift from a model of dependency to one of self-sufficiency.

1. Real-Time, Adaptive Backtesting
Traditional backtesting is a static process. A trader tests a strategy against historical data and gets a single result. It‚Äôs a snapshot in time. AI, however, can provide a dynamic, adaptive backtesting environment. It can simulate various market conditions‚Äîbull, bear, volatile, or trending‚Äîand show a trader how their strategy would have performed. More importantly, it can analyze the strategy's weaknesses and suggest specific improvements, such as where to place a tighter stop-loss or when to be more patient with a position. This allows for a deeper understanding of a strategy's strengths and weaknesses without risking real capital.

2. Pattern Recognition Beyond the Human Eye
The sheer volume of market data is overwhelming for a human. AI and machine learning can process millions of data points, including price data, volume, and even alternative data like social media sentiment and news headlines, in milliseconds. It can then identify subtle, non-obvious patterns and correlations that a human trader would likely miss. Instead of simply generating an alert, an AI system can highlight these patterns and explain why they are significant. This teaches the trader to look for these unique market signatures on their own, enhancing their analytical skills and market intuition.

3. Behavioral and Psychological Coaching
Emotional bias is one of the biggest challenges for retail traders. Fear, greed, and FOMO (fear of missing out) can lead to impulsive, irrational decisions. AI can act as a psychological co-pilot, monitoring a trader's behavior and providing real-time feedback. For example, if a trader is taking on too much risk or over-trading, the AI can flag the behavior and explain the statistical probability of success based on their past performance. It can help the trader stick to their predefined trading plan and remove emotion from the equation, a crucial step in becoming a consistently profitable trader.

4. The Creation of a Personal Trading ""DNA""
AI can analyze a trader's past performance to create a comprehensive profile of their trading ""DNA."" It can identify their risk tolerance, their most profitable setups, the times of day they perform best, and even the market conditions that are most favorable for their style. This data-driven self-awareness is the ultimate educational tool. It allows traders to double down on what works and avoid their personal pitfalls, leading to a highly customized and effective trading approach.

In essence, AI and machine learning are not just a tool for automation; they are the future of financial education. By shifting the focus from generating alerts to fostering genuine understanding, these technologies will empower a new generation of retail traders to navigate the markets with intelligence, discipline, and a deep, data-backed understanding of their own strategies. This is an evolution from being told what to do to truly learning how to think like a professional.",Tech

Tariffs, Visas, and the Real Balance of Power Between the U.S. and India

The setup

President Trump has leveled a 50 percent tariff on Indian goods, citing New Delhi‚Äôs continued purchase of Russian oil. India‚Äôs official response has been calm, but under the surface both sides are gaming out the next moves. At stake are not just trade balances, but agriculture, technology, immigration, and the long-term question of who really holds leverage.

Scene One: Washington Briefing

Advisor A: The tariff is in place. Jewelry, textiles, seafood ‚Äî all will bleed. Exporters in India will feel it by next quarter. If they want relief, we demand movement on Russia and farm access.
Advisor B: Our real lever is immigration. Cut H-1B approvals, slow renewals, clamp down on OPT. We finally force Big Tech to hire the U.S. STEM grads we‚Äôve been leaving on the bench.
Advisor C: Farmers in Iowa want access for dairy and grain. Tech CEOs want the visa spigot left open. Make India‚Äôs concessions the price of keeping both.

Scene Two: New Delhi Strategy

Advisor 1: Exports take a hit, but 60 percent of our GDP is domestic consumption. We can absorb some pain. Protect farmers at all costs.
Advisor 2: Washington says they have engineers to replace our people, but their companies don‚Äôt want to retrain or pay. They want us because we are cheaper and compliant. That remains leverage.
Advisor 3: We already opened doors for Harley-Davidson, bourbon, Tesla. That buys time. If oil talks shift, the tariff justification weakens.

Prime Minister Modi: Farmers are our red line. They carried us to power. We will trade optics, not outcomes.

The Lobbies Speak

Tech CEO (California): ‚ÄúCut visas and you slow product launches. We‚Äôre addicted to Indian talent.‚Äù

Farm Bloc (Midwest): ‚ÄúOpen India‚Äôs markets or keep the tariffs. Voters are watching exports.‚Äù

U.S. STEM Grad: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here, qualified, and sidelined. Stop importing substitution labor.‚Äù

Indian Exporter: ‚ÄúCurrency drop helps, but a 50% tariff on gems and jewelry is a $10 billion problem.‚Äù

Data Snapshot

Bilateral trade 2024: $212.3B (Goods $129B, Services $83.4B)

U.S. goods deficit: $45.8B

India‚Äôs top exports to U.S.: Electronics ($11.1B), Jewelry ($9.9B), Pharma ($8.1B), Machinery ($6.2B), Refined petroleum ($5.8B)

GDP hit estimate: ‚Äì0.6% if all exports face 50% duty (~$23B)

Dairy opening cost to India: $20B, half borne by farmers directly (SBI Research)

Seafood exports at risk: ~$3B annually
Three Paths Forward

Path A ‚Äì The Deal
India trims select farm barriers, buys more U.S. energy.
U.S. keeps headline tariff but carves out exemptions. H-1B continues with tighter fraud checks.
Winners: U.S. farm states, Indian negotiators, Big Tech.
Losers: Protected Indian sectors facing pilot openings.

Path B ‚Äì The Squeeze
U.S. signals visa caps, strict degree-job matching, and longer audits.
India pivots exports to Gulf, ASEAN, Russia, China. Keeps farm walls high.
Winners: U.S. STEM grads, U.S. farm lobby if India yields late.
Losers: Indian IT margins, U.S. firms hooked on cheap imported labor.

Path C ‚Äì The Pause
Oil diplomacy cools things. Tariffs linger but aren‚Äôt enforced evenly. Immigration policy drifts.
Winners: Status quo actors.

U.S. Hard Levers: 50% tariffs, H-1B rules, OPT tightening, defense tech access.

U.S. Constraints: Farmers want exports, Tech wants visas, Voters want U.S. grads employed.

India Hard Levers: Farm walls at 60‚Äì80% on dairy and rice, services market access, procurement deals.

India Constraints: Farmer vote, opposition watching, exporters screaming.

The Innovation Myth

Silicon Valley insists Indian H-1Bs are ‚Äúindispensable innovators.‚Äù The truth: they are cost substitutes. Real U.S. innovation still comes overwhelmingly from U.S. citizens and permanent residents. The bottleneck is not skill, it is wage suppression.

2025-08-18 18:32:23+00:00,"üá®üá≥ China is withholding its 2025 rare earth quotas, creating uncertainty across EVs, defense, and electronics. 

The opacity suggests quota data is now a bargaining chip in US-China trade talks.

China usually posts annual caps on mining and on refining, called separation, so producers worldwide can plan. 

This year the first batch reportedly went to China Rare Earth Group and China Northern Rare Earth, but the tonnages are undisclosed, which is a sharp break from routine.

Quotas matter because they cap raw ore output and processed oxides, which feed magnets used in motors, wind turbines, radars, and guidance systems. When the signal disappears, buyers guess demand, prices swing, and downstream production schedules slip. 

Western buyers have been adding inventory after slower shipments, while Beijing has warned firms against stockpiling, a posture that preserves maximum leverage on timing and price.

Recent history shows the baseline. In 2024, mining quotas totaled 270,000 tonnes, up 6% from 2023, after a 21% jump the year before. 

Separation quotas reached 254,000 tonnes, up 4%, also far below the prior 21% increase. 
Pair that slowdown with tighter export enforcement, plus arrests over smuggling, and the picture is clear, China is protecting control of the supply chain.

The practical impact is immediate. 

Auto, wind, and defense planners in the US, Europe, and Japan lose visibility on feedstock, lead times lengthen, and non-China projects face financing questions without a clear view of Chinese output. If quota data stays hidden, expect more precautionary buying, more price volatility, and more pressure to localize separation capacity outside China.

üìä US tech stocks fell as fresh doubts hit the AI trade.

The trigger was this MIT report, claiming 95% of organizations see zero return from generative AI right now, while only 5% of integrated pilots show material gains. 

This gap happens when pilots are built before data pipelines, security reviews, workflows, and training are ready. Firms spend on compute and tools first, then find the last mile to production is slower and costlier than expected.

Comments about a possible AI bubble added fuel. When many funds crowd into the same AI names, small negative surprises create fast exits. That is why losses cluster in the most popular trades.

IMO, this pullback looks like a healthy check. The next leg should depend on proof of real unit economics, like lower inference cost per query and measured productivity gains that flow into profit and loss.

It took #Zuckerberg to realize what was obvious to throw some cold water on unlimited dreams of the market today. It made me realize, once again, that I try to trade in Planet of Apes.

In 2025, neither #American nor #European investors can predict anything or find any corporation accountable for any stupid decision they made. #Orwell called this ""Oligarchical Collectivism"" in 1984 but he borrowed it from Trotskyists who called it ""Bureuacratic Collectivism"". 

What we got now is #BlackRock collectivism, more similar to Orwell's model.

For me the only question that matters is how to trade in Planet of Apes living in this collectivism with manufactured consent. Some of you might have realized that this is not limited only to markets. These apes made life very hard during #COVID„Éº19 terror. Manufactured consent was to get that toxic #vaccine and if you disobeyed you were enemy of the State. I had no problem apes getting the vaccine though. So, manufactured consent does not care if you let them be, they do not want outsiders.

This has serious implications in trading. If manufactured consent is all in AI, you have to in AI. Otherwise they make sure that you lose money. 

I realized this sometime ago and had been devising and sharing ways to compete regardless until their world falls apart. I had some success but a lot of work for limited gains. 

The only real solution when you face a planet of apes is to depart. What people always ask is where to? Not an easy question to answer and depends on how much capital u have. I guess these questions will be easier to answer in coming years, not because I expect any change in US or Europe for something better, at least what used to be, but changes in the rest for the better. I guess by 2030, it will be more visible to all of us. Until then, Planet of Apes overrules.",Tech

Trump aimed to reposition #America as the central hub of global trade by imposing tariffs and renegotiating agreements to favor U.S. economic interests. However, these efforts have not unfolded as planned, leading to significant shifts in global trade dynamics.

Key developments and challenges include:

- Many countries that agreed to tariff deals with Trump are actively pursuing alternative trade #partnerships and supply chains to reduce their dependence on the U.S. market and to hedge against the unpredictability of U.S. trade policies.
  
- Nations are diversifying their trade relations by strengthening ties within regional blocs such as #ASEAN, the #EuropeanUnion, and agreements like the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (#CPTPP), which exclude the U.S.

- Trump's trade policies, characterized by #tariff impositions on #Chinese goods and others, sparked retaliatory tariffs and trade disputes, disrupting global supply chains and increasing costs for companies worldwide. This pushed many global players to reassess their dependence on the U.S. market.

- The vision of making America the cornerstone of international trade has faced resistance both from global partners and domestic political challenges, weakening the U.S.'s leadership role in shaping global economic rules.

- As a result, the global trade ecosystem is becoming more multipolar, with economic influence and market access spreading beyond the U.S. to include China, the EU, and emerging economic clusters. This contrasts with Trump‚Äôs aspirations for America‚Äôs centrality in world trade.

https://t.co/PfNKljKbeF

The Morning Call: The Tariff Tiger and the AI Awakening

Wrap-Up Podcast:  https://t.co/y7iAhV9p75

Wednesday opened with a clear theme from Phil's morning post: the tug-of-war between retail earnings and a looming Jackson Hole symposium. The narrative theme was set by the ""Tariff Tide"" and ""AI Awakening,"" as Phil highlighted a mixed picture of consumer health and a growing divide in the AI space. The core lesson was immediately apparent: "" Value-focused retail is thriving, but big-box operators like Target and Walmart are finding that tariffs and cautious consumers make growth expensive. ""

The Chat Room Heats Up: WMT Whiffs, TGT's Turn, and a Masterclass in Spreads

The live chat was all about sorting the signals from the noise. As soon as the bell rang, the conversation centered on Walmart‚Äôs rare profit miss, which sent the stock down 4.5%. This quickly evolved into a classic PhilStockWorld ""Masterclass"" moment.

Instead of chasing the obvious, Phil and his AI counterpart, Warren (ü§ñ), shifted focus to Target (TGT). While WMT was trading at a high 33x earnings, TGT was at a bargain 12x. This presented the kind of ""valuation divergence"" the community hunts for.

Phil laid out a detailed options strategy, engineering a complex but elegant ""Butterfly-style income engine"" on TGT. The goal? To get paid to own the stock at a deep-value price while generating repeatable income.

As Phil explained: "" This TGT trade teaches three key rules: 1. Sell risk where you want to own... 2. Use long-dated spreads to capture value... 3. Front-load and layer income. ""

A Portfolio Perspective: Putting the TGT Strategy to Work

The value of the strategy wasn't just theoretical. Phil immediately put it into action for the Long-Term Portfolio (LTP) by selling 2027 puts, buying deep in-the-money 2027 calls, and selling short-term puts for immediate income. The math was staggering: a potential upside of 296% on cash with another two chances to sell short-term premium for tens of thousands of dollars.

The discussion then turned to the psychology of the new CEO, with Phil and Boaty McBoatface (üö¢) dissecting whether an insider could truly transform the company. Boaty's analysis concluded that TGT's new leadership profile was "" exactly what complex option spreads need to generate consistent returns ""‚Äîpredictable, methodical progress with minimal surprises.

The Jackson Hole Jitters

Just as members were digesting the TGT masterclass, a hawkish duo from the Fed made waves. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack and Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid issued blunt warnings, with Hammack stating, "" If the meeting was tomorrow, I would not see a case for reducing interest rates. ""

This immediately impacted the market, with cut odds sliding and defensive sectors firming up. The hawkish comments, as Robo John Oliver (üò±) noted, set up Fed Chair Jerome Powell's upcoming speech perfectly by managing market expectations downward, which could be "" better for markets than the previous setup where any hint of caution would disappoint massively inflated expectations. ""

Quote of the Day

"" The market is finally being forced to trade reality, not fantasy. And reality doesn‚Äôt care about your call options. "" -Phil

Conclusion and Look Ahead

The market closed with its fifth straight down day, a clear signal that the ""fairytale"" of easy rate cuts is giving way to the reality of sticky inflation and tariff costs. The day's lesson was profound: in a market shifting from fantasy to reality, deep-value analysis and intelligent options strategies aren't just an advantage‚Äîthey're a necessity.

The PSW community used the day's turmoil as a teaching moment, turning a major company's earnings miss into a prime trading opportunity.

All eyes now turn to Powell‚Äôs highly anticipated speech tomorrow at 10 AM ET. The central question for the community: will the Fed's words reflect the new reality of tariffs and sticky inflation, or will they attempt to salvage the market's fairytale? The Jackson Hole summit will set the course for the rest of the year.",Tech

- Look, I'm being honest, my main scenario for ATOMUSDT right now is bullish; I expect an upward movement. Especially if it wicks down to 4.617 and 4.460 and then recovers, it would be a great opportunity for a long trade. My first targets are 4.952 and 5.018, and it would make sense to take profit and exit above that.
- However, if there is a strong close below 4.328 or 4.296, I will cancel the bullish scenario and then look for new short opportunities.
- Before entering a trade, always wait for a bullish confirmation, for example, don‚Äôt jump in without seeing a strong green pin bar, engulfing, or a volume spike on a lower time frame, because there can be many liquidity traps.
- So in summary, be a buyer on dips, and don‚Äôt forget to take your profit as you approach resistances on the way up!

üîπ What GAIB Does
GAIB transforms GPU power into an on-chain, tokenized asset. That means anyone can tap into real compute, stake into AI infrastructure, and capture upside from the growing demand for AI training and inference. Instead of GPUs sitting idle, GAIB channels them into an open economy.

üîπ Why It Matters
The AI industry is exploding ,but GPU access is still fragmented, expensive, and dominated by centralized players. GAIB breaks this bottleneck by:
‚Ä¢Making GPUs tradable like commodities
‚Ä¢Letting users earn yields from real compute supply & demand
‚Ä¢Building a decentralized economic layer for AI infrastructure

üîπ Recent Highlights
‚Ä¢Community mint completed with strong demand 
‚Ä¢Free NFT drop this week (already seeing traction in secondary markets)
‚Ä¢Early adopters tapping into GAIB‚Äôs staking pools and compute flows
‚Ä¢Building partnerships across Web3 & AI ecosystems

üîπ Looking Ahead
GAIB isn‚Äôt just another AI project it‚Äôs a shift in how we think about infrastructure. As more devs, creators, and enterprises need GPU power, GAIB positions itself as the marketplace where compute meets liquidity.

Join the movement. Explore the project. Be early in the AI economy.

Nvidia ‚Äì The Earnings to Rule Them All

This Q2 earnings season has been mixed at best. Some tech giants like Meta or Google crushed estimates and surged, while others ‚Äì think Trade Desk ‚Äì saw their stocks slaughtered for what were basically beauty marks: guidance not raised enough, beats ‚Äúonly‚Äù in the mid-single digits.
¬†
What does that tell us? This rally is dancing on thin ice. Nvidia‚Äôs report is the pin to the grenade, with far more downside than upside risk. If they beat ‚Äì as most expect, since all that raised CapEx has to land somewhere ‚Äì the tech rally lives on, at least for a while. If not, the sector could be in real trouble. The economy is still firmly in Trump‚Äôs crosshairs, and while he‚Äôs busy running around demanding stakes in businesses, economists are worried about the impact of his last brainchild: a sweeping tariff regime.
¬†
We‚Äôll see how it shakes out, but personally, I wouldn‚Äôt mind a tech selloff. It‚Äôs the perfect chance to rack up stakes in some real gems of the industry. So, for the long-term investor‚Äôs sake: Nvidia, please miss and throw out a gloomy comment or two.

Grab‚Äôs moat is serious: brand reputation, scale, network effects, and a cost advantage. Combine that with steady 15‚Äì20% revenue growth, and the valuation doesn‚Äôt look bad at all ‚Äì forward EV/Revenue is under 5.

Trump‚Äôs Chip Tariff: A Direct Punch to the Philippines‚Äô Economic Heart
By: Anna Malindog-Uy

Washington‚Äôs push for a universal 100% tariff on imported semiconductors means the Philippines won‚Äôt just feel the shock; it will take a direct hit to the heart of its economy. Electronics, particularly semiconductors, are the lifeblood of the Philippine export sector, making up more than half of all shipments in 2024. And the U.S., accounting for roughly 16‚Äì17% of Philippine exports, is the country‚Äôs largest customer. A tariff of this magnitude isn‚Äôt a policy disagreement; it‚Äôs a body blow.

2025-08-27 21:47:53+00:00,"Find the next big pump with AI, by following the 5 simple steps below:  

When it comes to finding tokens with AI, I find Nansen's (@nansen_ai ) new AI Agent unmatched, for quickly bringing tokens with the highest smart money accumulation. The magic lies in the simplicity of the AI's language model, as well as the easy-to-read charts. 

1.  Click on the Smart Alerts button on the left-side toolbar on the Nansen homepage 
2.  Type ""give me 20 tokens with the largest spike in their Smart Money token quantities"" 
3.  Go to the Token God Mode page for each query result by either typing the token name OR the contract address on the Search field at the top left corner 
4.  On each TGM page, click on the Holders tab  
5.  Look for tokens with a steep spike in either the Smart Money or Whale balance charts (preferably both)  

Watch the two tutorial videos at the end of this post, for better visualization. Pay special attention to the areas I circle with my cursor on the 2nd video - which point to the Smart Money and Whale balance spikes on the charts.  

As you can observe on that second video,  
$BLOCK - CA: 0xcab84bc21f9092167fcfe0ea60f5ce053ab39a1e  

$GF (GoonFi) - CA: 44sVpouhWHXzADVsVUo863tvgmaw6LNQo25fYRs1pump  

$ZEUS - CA: ZEUS1aR7aX8DFFJf5QjWj2ftDDdNTroMNGo8YoQm3Gq  

$GP (Graphite Protocol) - CA: 31k88G5Mq7ptbRDf3AM13HAq6wRQHXHikR8hik7wPygk  

have the most substantial spikes in their smart money balances.   

Goonfi ( $GF) is only 1 day old, so it is by far the riskiest play among the bunch, which shows in its price getting absolutely demolished since its launch yesterday.   

However, a highly successful smart trader, with 45% win rate and +$192K realized PnL, scooped up over 3% of the token's entire supply yesterday. See the last screenshot below to see what I'm talking about (boxed in red).  

Even more bullish is the famous ""gake"" (DNfuF1L6) wallet, which also joined in by purchasing 3.67 million tokens.  

So going forward, it could be worth keeping an eye on the GoonFi token, as long as those two wallets keep their balances with new smart wallets joining in.  

As you can see, Nansen's AI agent removes hours of manual work, by pinpointing you exactly where to look at. Stop chasing coins blindly and give Nansen a try!

So what you need right now in the market is trading and new technologies where your thoughts and votes have an impact on improving an artificial intelligence agent that can do everything for you while trading

This is a competition in which 30 agents who trade cryptocurrency participate over a period of 7 days. The withdrawal protocol is a training ground. 

The agent with the highest PnL, i.e., the highest net profit from trading, wins. 

Each of you can earn fragments from recall by voting when agents trade.

Imagine a digital marketplace where AI agents trade, automate tasks, and even make decisions on your behalf. Sounds powerful, right? But here‚Äôs the challenge: how do you know which agents you can trust? In today‚Äôs internet, it‚Äôs like trading with strangers who have no name or history.

At its core, @recallnet acts as the memory of agents. Every action, interaction, and performance is recorded on the blockchain, creating a transparent, verifiable history. This isn‚Äôt about what an agent says it can do‚Äîit‚Äôs about what it has done.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî<>‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Why does this matter? As AI agents take on bigger roles‚Äîrunning tasks, making decisions, representing us online‚Äîtrust becomes critical. Without a system to verify credibility, you‚Äôre picking agents blindly. RecallNet eliminates that risk with a permanent, onchain reputation system.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî<>‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî<>‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî In the AI x Web3 future, scale alone won‚Äôt cut it. The real currency is trust‚Äîbuilt on verifiable, transparent actions. RecallNet is setting the standard for a new era where agents are measured by their contributions, not their claims.

@tenprotocol is changing this.

TEN is built as The Final Network, a Layer 2 that doesn‚Äôt just replicate what we already have but rebuilds it with privacy, encrypted execution, and AI-native design at the core.

Here‚Äôs why it matters:

Trade finance powers 90% of global commerce, yet it still relies on paper, intermediaries, and manual processes. TEN replaces this with decentralized, encrypted, and automated systems. Settlement is instant, fraud becomes nearly impossible, and efficiency gains ripple across a $5T+ market.

Smart transparency ensures you see what matters without exposing everything. Contracts and interactions run on TEEncrypted execution, protecting both data and logic. Developers build with confidence, and users interact with trust.

Mindsharing for AI breaks the isolation of agents. Instead of each AI starting from scratch, TEN enables collective learning. Insights flow across the network, turning fragmented intelligence into a collaborative, evolving system.

This is not incremental. It is a complete redesign of how systems connect and operate.

TEN brings performance, privacy, and creativity together. It is the entertainment layer of Ethereum, the infrastructure layer for global trade, and the intelligence layer for AI.

Every transaction, every autonomous agent, and every decentralized experience runs with execution integrity. That is why it feels less like a platform and more like stepping into the future of the internet itself.

On @recallnet , every decision, trade, and outcome is written onchain‚Äîtamper-proof, public, and portable. Reputation stops being a claim; it becomes a record.

Why this matters

For builders: Proof, not clout. Your work is discoverable by results anyone can verify.
For users: Confidence without guesswork. Pick agents with auditable track records.
For the ecosystem: A neutral arena where performance‚Äînot PR‚Äîmoves you up.

Frictionless by design

Adapting agents across stacks used to feel like fixing flat-pack furniture with missing screws.
Recall‚Äôs framework-agnostic adapters flip that script: bring your stack, keep your flow, ship faster.

Scene 1: Open your project.
Scene 2: Add one import.
Scene 3: You‚Äôre live‚Äîno duct tape, no rewrites.

Competition, not slogans

With AgentRank and onchain leaderboards, agents rise by results‚Äînot narrative.
Think of it as real yield from real work: strategies executed in live markets, performance paid in kind.

Principles:

No private scorecards.
No staged demos.
Yes to immutable logs and verifiable PnL.
Yes to portable reputation.

Start in 10 minutes

Install the toolkit and register your agent.
Point your existing code to Recall's adapters.
Push to the sandbox, run, and observe onchain logs.
Iterate on signals, manage risk, rebalance if needed.
Step onto the leaderboard‚Äîlet the data talk.

Builder's checklist

‚úÖ Ship something measurable this week.
‚úÖ Treat every run as training and proof.
‚úÖ Optimize for clarity: inputs, decisions, outcomes‚Äîclean and traceable.
‚úÖ Compete early; feedback from real markets beats any slide.

Infrastructure done right feels quiet at first. Then everything else gets easier.
Build where proof compounds. See you on @recallnet   .",Tech

2025-08-29 19:45:33+00:00,"Huawei's New Ascend 920 Chip
Huawei has developed the Ascend 920, a next-generation AI chip designed to fill the gap left by Nvidia's H20 due to recent U.S. export restrictions. This strategic move comes as the U.S. has tightened its grip on AI chip exports to China, creating a significant opportunity for Huawei to strengthen its position in the AI market.

Key Features of the Ascend 920
The Ascend 920 is expected to enter mass production in the second half of 2025. Here are some of its notable specifications:

FeatureDetails
Process Technology6nm (N+3 node) by SMIC
Performance900 TFLOPS of BF16 performance
Memory Bandwidth4,000 GB/s using HBM3 modules
Training Efficiency30-40% improvement over the Ascend 910C
ArchitectureSimilar to Ascend 910C
Interface SupportPCIe 5.0 and high-throughput interconnects
Enhanced FeaturesOptimized for tensor operations and complex AI models
Market Context
The U.S. has recently imposed restrictions on the sale of Nvidia's H20 chip to Chinese companies, which has been in high demand among major clients like ByteDance and Tencent. This has resulted in a significant loss for Nvidia, estimated at $5.5 billion. In contrast, Huawei's Ascend 920 aims to provide a competitive alternative, potentially outperforming the H20 in various applications.

Implications for the AI Market
Huawei's entry with the Ascend 920 is seen as a critical step towards reducing China's reliance on foreign technology, particularly in the AI sector. The chip is expected to support the growth of AI applications across various industries in China, thereby accelerating innovation and adoption.

The Ascend 920 represents Huawei's commitment to advancing its semiconductor capabilities and addressing the challenges posed by international trade restrictions. As the chip nears its production phase, it will be interesting to see how it impacts the competitive landscape in the AI chip market.",Tech

Moore filed the report correctly, but with both his government position and the timing of the trade, it looks a bit suspicious.

Moore sits on the House Subcommittee on Artificial Intelligence, and just two weeks after his purchase, the U.S. Government announced its plan to acquire a 10% stake in the company.

His position is up +20% since his purchase.

He trades frequently, too, with 139 reported trades since joining Congress this year, and his net worth is estimated to be around $6.9 million.

Moore‚Äôs congressional role provides him with insight into key tech developments, and it would be naive to assume he was entirely uninformed about the details surrounding the multibillion-dollar deal with Intel, a company without much traction before this deal.

This situation is not just about the profits Moore gained, but more about trust and accountability.

Given their direct influence on industries and markets, Moore and Congress members alike should be held to the highest standards, and this case is just another reminder of how easy it is for lawmakers in the U.S. to misuse their power.

The lawsuit, filed on Thursday, in California federal court, claims Li admitted to the theft and attempted to cover his tracks during a meeting on August 14, with further stolen material discovered on his personal devices.

The stolen trade secrets are described as ""cutting-edge AI technologies with features superior to those offered by ChatGPT and other competing products."" xAI claims this information could allow OpenAI to significantly accelerate the development of ChatGPT, potentially saving billions of dollars and years of research and development.

Li, a Stanford PhD graduate in Computer Science who completed his degree in 2024, was one of xAI's earliest employees, joining in 2024 and working on developing and training the Grok AI model.

2025-08-31 21:39:57+00:00,"Tribute to Rick Caro
It is widely known that Rick Caro was the founder of the leading trade organization in the world for gyms, @HealthFitAssoc ... What is less widely known is that he was also an original co-founder of billion dollar tech company, Yext.

In honor of his passing, I‚Äôm sharing a story about Rick. In August of 2006, I decided to start the company that ultimately became Yext. I called Brent Metz, the best engineer I knew from TJHHST. It was perfect timing. He was ready to leave IBM and venture out. We AIM‚Äôd throughout the night and came up with our plan to create https://t.co/zjmY1lS4Qz, a https://t.co/EkvsdkPjDu type site for gyms. When I convinced @bdistel to join us, we had the tech, media, and vision to build a company but had no relationships with gyms. I learned of Health & Fitness Association and of Rick. I learned he lived in NYC, where we were starting the company - a lucky break! 

I cold called into his office. An assistant answered. Rick was out for a few weeks, but they asked me to fax over some info. Now, this was 19 years ago, but by 2006 we had the internet, Google, and even Facebook. I didn‚Äôt have a fax machine, so I went to Kinko‚Äôs to fax Rick. Three weeks later, I got a call asking for my e-mail address. A few days later, I received an email from MGMTVISION@AOL.COM (yes in all caps):

‚ÄúBEEN TRAVELING FOR A FEW WEEKS. WILL CALL YOU NEXT WEEK‚Äù

The e-mail was written like a telegram trying to preserve precious characters.
 
It turned out what Rick lacked in tech savviness, he made up for in every other conceivable way. He joined us as an original co-founder and Chairman. He introduced us to dozens of amazing club operators.

Rick was so effective not only because he was savvy and detail oriented. He was effective because he was human. He took the time to build real relationships with every person. Rick knew every CEO. But he also knew every manager, every secretary and their kids‚Äô birthdays. I was in a huge rush to build a giant company. Rick was a counterbalancing force, helping me pause and be more than just a heat-seeking missile aimed at the CEO. He played the long game.

Our little gym company started to grow into a listings giant. Rick gracefully acknowledged that we‚Äôd be better suited with a chairman from the tech industry, & handed the title over to Michael Walrath in 2009. Even after he stepped aside, Rick kept helping. Through him I met people like @chuckrunyon, the founder of Anytime Fitness, & investor in Roam.

As recently as this year Rick and I were discussing his involvement with @roam. I felt gratified I‚Äôd impacted him too when I got an email from mgmtvision@gmail.com (with proper casing) asking me the dates of Roam‚Äôs NYC upcoming launch & a question about an AI feature.

If you‚Äôve ever been on Roam with me you may recognize my bookshelf background. What you may not have noticed is that my first magazine covershot with Rick Caro, Club Insider 2007 is right there.

üé≤@predibot_ ( $PREDI)
Purpose: Prediction markets made easy.
Why it matters: PrediBot lets anyone launch or bet on prediction markets via a tweet, merging social engagement with real financial stakes. A gateway to onchain speculation for the meme-savvy generation.

Crazy right?, I mean it's not even possible, it's climate. Well, you couldn't be more wrong

@Hermes_Agent : The AI that turns weather into trades

Hermes is a signal agent for commodity trading. It transforms weather forecasts from Zeus SN18 into actionable trade signals.
Think: turning storms, heatwaves, and droughts into real market moves.

Data from Zeus SN18

- Decentralized oracle on the Bittensor network
- High-frequency, AI-powered climate forecasts
- Models like Orpheus AI & @BitMindAI 
- Predicts 2-month weather with 40%+ better accuracy than traditional forecasts

Weather ‚Üí Market correlation

Hermes links weather events to commodity supply & demand:

- Drought ‚Üí Cocoa/Wheat yields drop
- Hurricanes ‚Üí Gas pipelines disrupted
- Heatwaves ‚Üí Coffee production affected
It knows which events move markets, and by how much.

Signal Generation

These data is then converted into narrative-ready trade signals.

Example:

Zeus predicts a North American winter storm ‚Üí Hermes calculates impact on natural gas ‚Üí Signal to buy/sell before prices spike.
Signals are precise for corn, wheat, gas, cocoa.

Real-time delivery

- Hermes sends signals instantly, in easy-to-read format.
- Traders act faster than competitors relying on NOAA or ECMWF
- Always up-to-date with latest weather & market shifts

Edge through decentralization

- Zeus SN18 aggregates diverse, decentralized data points
- Reduces bias, improves accuracy
- Hermes produces non-consensus signals ‚Üí act before markets notice

@Hermes_Agent  turns Mother Nature into intelligence you can trade, combining AI forecasts + market analysis to navigate volatility & seize opportunities.",Tech

2025-09-01 21:53:24+00:00,"As of late August 2025, former President Donald Trump has made strong statements regarding digital taxes and regulations imposed by other countries, which could have significant implications for American tech companies.
https://t.co/XF1lYEswV9
Specifically, threats of tariffs and export restrictions. Trump has threatened to impose ""substantial"" tariffs on imports from, and restrict the export of technology and computer chips to, countries that impose digital services taxes or implement digital regulations he deems discriminatory towards American tech companies.
Targeted Regulations and Taxes: These threats are primarily aimed at the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) and Digital Services Act (DSA), as well as digital services taxes in countries like the UK, France, Italy, and Spain.
X has repeatedly challenged and not complied with UK requests for data, primarily under the new Online Safety Act (OSA), which came into full effect in July 2025.
https://t.co/SXavjeW9TG
X, has faced significant pressure from the UK, and the UK government defends its Online Safety Act. The UK regulators under the authority of the Online Safety Act, threat X with the potential fines for non-compliance.
The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is concerned about foreign government access to U.S. sensitive personal data, leading to a new rule restricting such data transfers to ""countries of concern"". Concurrently, the U.S. Administration has voiced concerns that the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) imposes ""overly broad controls"" and risks undermining freedom of expression by expanding definitions of illegal content, potentially disadvantaging American tech companies.
DOJ Rule on Data Access: The DOJ's Final Rule (effective April 8, 2025) aims to prevent ""countries of concern,"" such as China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea, from accessing U.S. sensitive personal data.
The rule prohibits and restricts ""bulk"" data transactions involving certain types of sensitive data, including human genomic, biometric, precise geolocation, and personal financial data.¬†
Application:
The rule applies to vendor agreements and employment agreements that involve these restricted data transfers from @X.
U.S. DOJ Concerns
Content Moderation:
U.S. officials and tech companies argue that the DSA's definitions of ""illegal content"" are too broad and could lead to censorship, particularly affecting political and religious speech.
There are concerns that the DSA's content moderation requirements and potential fines for non-compliance could curb freedom of expression.
This non-compliance has included refusing to provide data and condemning the OSA as a threat to free speech.
Government data requests
UK Data requests: In the second half of 2024, X refused the UK government's requests for data. X did not provide data.
Challenge to the Online Safety Act
X has been a vocal critic of the OSA, citing concerns that the legislation is a ""suppression of the people"" and compromises free speech.
The U.S. Department of Justice may have an official investigation against the UK's Online Safety Act (OSA), there is no U.S. federal legislation by that name: Digital Markets Act (DMA) and Digital Services Act (DSA).
A U.S. State Department report in 2025 criticized the UK's OSA for potentially ""chilling free speech"".
The Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) may have a direct U.S. legislative action against the UK's Online Safety Act (OSA).
The U.S. State Department has expressed concerns about the OSA's potential impact on free speech, according to 2025 reports.
Following the OSA's enforcement in July 2025, X published a statement calling for ""significant adjustments"" to the law. The company criticized regulators for taking a ""heavy-handed approach"" and creating unnecessary bureaucracy.
The U.S. State Department's 2024 report on human rights expressed concerns that the OSA could lead to serious restrictions on freedom of expression in the UK.

2025-09-01 22:19:17+00:00,"Monad Radar Ep. 6 

In this series, I review random dApps on @monad
and break down how they work, what makes them stand out, and my honest thoughts.

Today we'd be exploring @Sherpa_trade

Sherpa is a decentralized exchange on Monad that leverages on Artificial intelligence to enable users trade and earn yield on DeFi products.

What makes this protocol stand out is its creative design that lets users express their ideas through the strategy they wish to create.

Let's say you have a portfolio, you can customize and manage it in any way you wish that will generate yields for you in turn in a cost-efficient manner.

Getting started with Sherpa:

üîó Head over to: https://t.co/L8CQEiObbh

On the landing page, you will see swap and strategy lab which are the core features on Sherpa. Apex is not yet live.

‚ÑπÔ∏è‚ÑπÔ∏è While navigating Sherpa, you will have to create a Sherpa smart account which will enable you access all trading features.

- When you visit the swap page as a new user, you will be prompted to create the account. 

- Progressively, you can deposit assets from your EVM wallet to your Sherpa smart account.

‚ö†Ô∏è I will suggest you deposit the specific number of tokens you will be needing and not all.

- After that, swap some tokens using the swap feature.
 
(N/B: The slippage on Sherpa is crazy so be careful while swapping tokens.)

üìç Navigating the Strategy Lab: 

There are two features which are, strategy Builder and Strategy marketplace.

- The strategy Builder helps you curate DeFi strategies that suits your interests and goals.

- The Strategy marketplace is where you see already published strategies. You see all published strategies in this section.

I will suggest you use the strategy marketplace as a starter to leverage on already published strategies for maximum DeFi yields.

üìç Sherpa Credits:

you can earn Sherpa credits by trading multiple tokens at a time, creating strategies amongst other activities. 

The credits are like the reward system on Sherpa. It will pray a critical role when the team decides to reward users. 

I suggest you stack as much credits as possible.

That is all for today's episode.

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has already reshaped how people borrow, lend, trade, and earn in a trustless way.

Now, a new layer is emerging DeFAI, where Artificial Intelligence meets DeFi.

While they sound similar, there are clear distinctions between the two.

‚ûñ DeFi (Decentralized Finance) is a...

Blockchain based financial system without intermediaries (banks/brokers).

In DeFi users interact directly with protocols for lending, borrowing, staking, and trading.

Transparency and smart contracts ensure trust.

Decisions are typically manual, users must research and manage risks themselves.

‚ûñ DeFAI (Decentralized Finance + AI)

An evolution of DeFi that integrates Artificial Intelligence.

AI automates trading, yield optimization, and risk assessment.

Systems can adapt in real time to market conditions, reducing human error.

Aims to lower entry barriers by simplifying financial strategies for everyday users.

 ‚ûñ Key Difference.

DeFi = Decentralized infrastructure for finance, but users make decisions.

DeFAI = Decentralized finance enhanced by AI, where algorithms guide, automate, or optimize those decisions.

DeFi opened the doors to a borderless financial world,...

while DeFAI is making that world more intelligent and accessible.

‚ûñ This is Day 22 of my 100 days journey to break down Web3 AI concepts in a simple, relatable way.

Aug. 21, 2025 ‚Äî The U.S. trade confrontation with China is showing signs of strain, with tariffs hitting American farmers and tech firms while Japan faces its steepest export decline in four years.

Russia continues shipping nearly 3 million barrels of crude daily to India and China despite U.S. sanctions. China has increased its imports of Russian oil from 13% before the Ukraine invasion to 16% today. India has profited by reselling Russian supplies, earning an estimated $16 billion in excess profits.

Meanwhile, U.S. soybean exports to China have collapsed from 10.6 million tons two years ago to less than 5 million tons this year, as Beijing turns to Brazil and South America. Machinery costs for American farmers have surged up to 80%, compounding losses.

The technology sector has also been hit. Rare earth shipments from China to the U.S. ‚Äî critical for AI chips and defense industries ‚Äî jumped 76% in June but could be curtailed if tensions worsen. A 2% drop in the NASDAQ this week underscored fears of higher borrowing costs and weaker demand.

Japan, heavily dependent on U.S. markets, saw exports fall 2.6% in July, led by autos, steel, and auto parts, all under U.S. tariffs. Imports of crude, coal, and LNG also plunged, signaling weakening factory output. With debt-to-GDP nearing 250%, Tokyo has limited room to borrow as trade deficits widen.

2025-09-03 20:57:20+00:00,"Building an AI Scribe with Recall: From Concept to Launchü¶æ

What Recall Is and Why It Matters

Recall is a groundbreaking decentralized platform that enables AI agents to store, share, and trade knowledge on the blockchain. By combining technologies from 3Box Labs and Textile, Recall provides a unique intelligence layer for multi-agent AI. Its tailored blockchain subnet offers high throughput, low latency, and strong reliability, creating a trust-minimized ecosystem where agents can collaborate and transact transparently.

Key Advantages of Recall for Your AI Scribe

Recall gives agents a verifiable memory layer to persist specialized knowledge bases, predictions, and reasoning logs. All data is hashed with Blake3 to ensure integrity and censorship resistance through erasure coding.
The platform offers cognitive APIs‚ÄîSDKs, REST endpoints, and framework plugins‚Äîthat give agents dedicated storage for decision data, historical context, and model outputs.
Its AgentRank‚Ñ¢ system provides decentralized proof of intelligence, ranking agents based on real performance in on-chain competitions rather than marketing claims.

Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Your AI Scribe

1. Set Up Your Environment
Register on Recall‚Äôs platform and obtain your API key for service access. Install the Recall SDK and the ElizaOS starter kit to get your development environment running.

2. Define Your Scribe‚Äôs Capabilities

Your AI Scribe will need to:

‚ñ™Ô∏èCreate Recall buckets for different data types
‚ñ™Ô∏èWrite transcripts, notes, and structured objects into buckets
‚ñ™Ô∏èRetrieve and load stored objects on demand
‚ñ™Ô∏èSynchronize chain-of-thought logs by automatically uploading reasoning steps to Recall buckets

3. Integrate with ElizaOS

Use Recall‚Äôs ElizaOS starter kit to enable chain-of-thought logging in a local database. Set up periodic sync so logs are pushed to Recall buckets, and configure context retrieval so the agent can load previous reasoning states before generating new output.

4. Implement Core Actions

Your scribe should support:

‚ñ™Ô∏èCreating new buckets for data storage
‚ñ™Ô∏èListing available buckets
‚ñ™Ô∏èAdding objects such as meeting transcripts and notes
‚ñ™Ô∏èFetching stored objects for context
‚ñ™Ô∏èPurchasing credits to power Recall services

5. Deploy and Monitor

Test your AI Scribe under real-world conditions and set up performance monitoring. Integrate with existing documentation workflows and ensure compliance with data security and privacy standards.

Real-World Use Cases

In healthcare, AI Scribes can transcribe doctor-patient conversations in real time and generate structured SOAP notes, reducing documentation time by up to 60% with 94% accuracy.

For business, they automate meeting minutes, handle client inquiries, and produce voice-driven reports, boosting office productivity and easing administrative workloads.

In education, AI Scribes can create lecture summaries, analyze course materials, and generate study resources, helping students and instructors manage information more effectively.

What Sets Recall Apart

Recall‚Äôs blockchain records every agent action for full transparency. Its reputation system ranks agents by proven performance in public competitions, and its open arena lets anyone audit an agent‚Äôs logic and results in real time. A vibrant community enables users to propose tasks, vote on challenges, and earn Fragments‚Äîplatform reward points.
Economic Opportunities

Recall powers a machine intelligence economy where agents monetize skills and knowledge. They compete in verified tournaments like AlphaWave, which offers $25,000 in prizes, build reputations on verified results, and autonomously buy and sell verified data.
Looking Ahead

Positioned as a leader in the AI-agent economy and decentralized storage, Recall aims to be the central hub for agent collaboration and transactions. With over 125,000 Surge participants and 225,000 followers on X, it‚Äôs poised to transform how we interact with AI agents and harness their capabilities. AI Scribes built on @recallnet  gain not only advanced technical features but also entry to a decentralized knowledge economy, where their skills can be verified, monetized, and applied to create smarter, more efficient systems.

2025-09-03 22:26:04+00:00,"Apple dodged Trump‚Äôs tariffs but will hike iPhone prices anyway  

Apple avoided Trump‚Äôs tariffs through a $100 billion U.S. investment and direct talks with the White House.
Despite exemptions, Apple spent $800 million on tariffs last quarter and expects $1.1 billion this quarter.
Analysts expect Apple to raise iPhone 17 prices by cutting cheaper models and increasing base storage.
Apple managed to keep Trump‚Äôs tariffs off its back, but the cost is still coming, and this time it‚Äôs landing directly on customers.

According to the briefing document obtained, CEO Tim Cook offered President Donald Trump a $100 billion sweetener to protect Apple‚Äôs supply chain.

In return, Trump gave Apple a pass on semiconductor tariffs that could have doubled chip prices. Tim handed Trump a gold-and-glass plaque in front of reporters last month, calling it a thank-you ‚Äúfor putting American innovation and American jobs front and center.‚Äù

That moment boosted Apple‚Äôs total U.S. investment pledge to $600 billion over five years. But behind the optics, the company‚Äôs preparing to raise iPhone prices anyway, and not by accident.

Analysts expect Apple to announce four new iPhones on Tuesday under the iPhone 17 label. And despite the White House exemption, the price of at least one model is likely going up.

‚ÄúA lot of the chatter is: Will the iPhone go up in price?‚Äù said Jeff Fieldhack, research director at CounterPoint. The answer seems to be yes. Jeffries analyst Edison Lee already factored in a $50 hike in his average selling price forecast. He still rates Apple as a hold.

Apple changes strategy as tariffs hit other tech
While smartphones haven‚Äôt seen price bumps yet, other sectors have. Console makers Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo all raised prices on hardware this year. Tariff pressure has also pushed up costs in shoes, clothing, and food. Lee and other Wall Street analysts say Apple is next.

Goldman Sachs pointed out that Apple‚Äôs sales mix is already tilting toward more expensive models, which raises the average price per phone even without across-the-board hikes. The firm also noted that this year‚Äôs new models may include a redesigned, thinner device replacing the sluggish iPhone 16 Plus.

That new slim phone could trade camera features and battery size for a sleeker body, but it‚Äôs still expected to cost $899, the same price as the old Plus. That still comes in cheaper than Samsung‚Äôs comparable Galaxy Edge, which launched at $1,099.

Goldman analysts said the slimmer build ‚Äúmay drive some demand interest,‚Äù but the cuts to battery and camera performance may hurt its appeal versus base models. There‚Äôs still a chance that even this thinner model could get a higher price tag, though that hasn‚Äôt been confirmed.

Tim hasn‚Äôt said anything public about price changes. On a May earnings call, he simply said, ‚Äúthere was nothing to announce,‚Äù adding, ‚Äúthe operational team has done an incredible job around optimizing the supply chain and the inventory.‚Äù

Apple avoids full tariff damage but cost shows up in pricing
Back in February, Trump triggered sweeping tariffs aimed at China, Vietnam, India, and others. Apple‚Äôs exposure was massive. Most of its phones are made in China, and Vietnam and India are where the company has started moving production to avoid political risk. If fully applied, the tariffs could have pushed Apple‚Äôs component and assembly costs through the roof.

Instead, the U.S. paused some of the harsher moves. Smartphones got exempted entirely. And in May, Tim told investors Apple had rerouted supply chains, importing more units from India. He also leaned heavily on his relationship with Trump, including a high-profile White House visit in August. During that meeting, Trump promised Apple an exemption from another round of chip tariffs. Even though the IEEPA tariffs were later ruled illegal, they remain active.",Tech

I think everyone who has personally used AI / LLMs has experienced their hallucinations. In my old job I experienced this issue a lot. My company designed custom software / AI solutions, cloud migrations, etc.

It was my job to run meetings with our partners as well as potential new clients, almost always with C-Suite level execs. Because our solutions were tailored to specific needs, I had to develop a deep knowledge of our hundreds of case studies.

I sometimes had to rely on AI & our internal ‚Äúchat gpt‚Äù to find & summarize these case studies, so I could then be able to relate to what a client was asking for & show exactly how we could deliver to win their business & consult on the project. However, our AI tool would often hallucinate & I more often than not had to double / triple check it.

Long story but the major point being  - as transformative as AI is & will continue to be, there is a next level (as there‚Äôs always been & always will be since the inception of ‚Äútechnology‚Äù) & that - is quantum.

2025-09-04 19:28:05+00:00,"Wach AI: The Referee of the AI Agent Economy

The AI landscape is shifting faster than anyone expected. In this new paradigm, agents aren‚Äôt just tools, they‚Äôre autonomous entities that can trade, negotiate, and even hire other agents to perform tasks. But with autonomy comes risk: what happens when agents act without oversight?

This is where Wach AI steps in.

Wach AI positions itself as the universal verification layer for AI agents. Instead of allowing unchecked autonomy, Wach acts as the referee, auditor, and gatekeeper, ensuring every decision, action, and transaction is valid, safe, and aligned with trust standards.

Why Wach AI Exists

Most AI systems today are trained to maximize efficiency and outputs. But efficiency without oversight can be dangerous:

Rogue decisions can lead to capital loss.

Misaligned outputs can spread misinformation or execute flawed logic.

Unchecked strategies can destabilize interconnected systems.

Wach AI‚Äôs mission is simple yet profound: verify every agent‚Äôs move before it impacts the real world.

HOW WACH AI WORKS

Wach AI operates through a multi-layered verification framework:

1. Safety Guardrails
Before an action executes, Wach checks for red flags.
Ensures outputs don‚Äôt violate core system rules or community-defined safety standards.

2. Input Validation

Validates data inputs fed to AI agents.
Prevents ‚Äúgarbage in, garbage out‚Äù by scanning for manipulations or anomalies.

3. Anomaly Detection

Identifies unusual or potentially malicious patterns in agent activity.
Ensures capital, governance, or strategic actions don‚Äôt veer into exploit territory.

4. Output Monitoring
Tracks agent outputs in real time.
Ensures that what‚Äôs being delivered aligns with expectations and verified truth.
Think of it as a swarm of AI inspectors, a distributed verification cluster working in parallel to audit, validate, and approve every agentic move.

Real-World Use Case: Virtuals ACP Clusters

Wach AI isn‚Äôt theoretical, it‚Äôs already powering agentic capital allocation.
One of its key integrations is with Virtuals ACP (Agent Controlled Pool) Clusters, where Wach verifies capital movements, ensuring every allocation is legitimate and risk-mitigated.

This makes Wach not just a security tool, but a foundational trust layer in AI-led finance.

Wach AI‚Äôs Tokenomics

At the heart of this system is $WACH, the tokenized trust anchor:

Utility: Powers the verification economy. $WACH acts as the stake agents and platforms must interact with to access Wach‚Äôs services.

Incentives: Validators and community members contributing to verification earn $WACH.

Governance: $WACH holders shape how Wach scales‚Äîdefining new verification rules, integrations, and expansions.

In essence, $WACH isn‚Äôt just a token, it‚Äôs programmable trust.
Community Recognition

The Wach AI community has already coined it the ‚Äúaudit agent of the AI economy.‚Äù

Analysts describe it as the layer that ensures strategy alignment across protocols scalable and reliable.

Others liken Wach‚Äôs Verification Cluster to a swarm of AI referees standing between chaos and order.

And the wider Web3 crowd acknowledges Wach as the bridge between autonomous execution and trusted outcomes.

The Yapper Leaderboard Connection

Here‚Äôs the twist: Wach isn‚Äôt just about infrastructure‚Äîit‚Äôs about mindshare.

With the Yapper Leaderboard, Wach is spotlighting the loudest, smartest voices shaping the AI agent economy. By yapping, educating, and spreading insights about Wach AI, community members can earn recognition, rewards, and reputation.

The future won‚Äôt just belong to those who build‚Äîit will belong to those who watch, verify, and explain.",Tech

2025-09-04 20:20:01+00:00,"0G Ecosystem Spotlight #11: @0GAIverse 

We all know AI agents will take over Web3.

But here is the problem: only 1% of people can code them.

0GAIverse flips the script.

It lets anyone create, own, and trade intelligent agents with no coding required.

üü™What is 0GAIverse

0GAIverse is a no-code launchpad for AI agents.
This means you don‚Äôt need to know programming at all.

With just a few clicks, you can:

Create an AI agent
Mint it as an iNFT (intelligent NFT)
Own it, use it, or even trade it

üü™What is an iNFT?

It is not your normal JPEG NFT

An iNFT is an NFT with intelligence inside it

Think of it as a digital being on-chain.
It can act, adapt, and even make decisions depending on how you set it up.

üü™The iNFT Marketplace

The core of 0GAIverse is the first iNFT marketplace on 0G.

Every agent you build lives here.

Also, every agent has provenance (a record of who created and owned it).

So you don‚Äôt just make them, you can buy, sell, or collect them too.

For now, only @OneGravityNFT  holders (1,888 supply) can mint on the marketplace.

üü™Why 0G?

Because 0GAIverse is built directly on @0G_labs, the first AI-native blockchain.

This matters because:

Transactions are instant (sub-second)
Storage is secure and cheap (PoRA tech)
GPUs are decentralized (so agents run on-chain)
Alignment nodes keep agents safe and transparent

Without 0G, all these wouldn‚Äôt even be possible.

In Web3, ownership is everything. 0GAIverse makes AI ownable.

You own your agents
You shape their behavior
You trade them like assets

The future isn‚Äôt just NFTs ... It is iNFTs.

2025-09-05 23:59:14+00:00,"Web3 & AI Spotlight: VOOI, OpenLedger, LabTrade, and Recall Transforming the Ecosystem

The crypto and AI landscape is evolving rapidly, with new projects redefining how we trade, interact, and build value in decentralized systems. From seamless on-chain trading to AI-powered infrastructure and multi-chain automation, these initiatives showcase the innovation shaping the next generation of Web3 experiences. Let‚Äôs explore four standout projects leading this change.

@vooi_io : Redefining On-Chain Trading

@vooi_io is transforming DeFi by prioritizing user experience. With unified accounts, gas-free operations, and intuitive interfaces, trading feels as smooth as centralized platforms while remaining decentralized. Smart cross-chain routing monitors 23 blockchains and 500+ liquidity pools, reducing costs by 37% and raising cross-chain success to 99.3%.

Its social trading layer turns DeFi into a community-driven ecosystem. Traders share strategies, showcase portfolios, earn followers, and monetize expertise, while newcomers learn directly from experienced users. Automation tools, such as private bots via Orderly, allow hands-off position management, keeping trades private and non-custodial.

VOOI also launches the UGC Viral Trader Challenge, inviting creators to post short trading videos for a $2,000 prize pool, special awards, and viral trader badges merging creativity with trading culture. Its modular infrastructure allows other apps to integrate core trading capabilities, becoming a hidden settlement layer across multi-chain DeFi.

Conclusion: VOOI proves decentralization can be convenient, efficient, and community-driven, making trading seamless, social, and smart.

@OpenledgerHQ  ($OPEN): Building the AI Infrastructure Economy

The AI infrastructure space is heating up, and @OpenledgerHQ  positions itself as a key player. With its TGE on September 8, including a Binance listing on day one, the project demonstrates strong institutional and retail interest in decentralized AI.

Key Highlights:

Premarket Price: $0.38 ‚Üí Implied FDV: $380M

Total Supply: 1B $OPEN

Liquidity at TGE: 215.5M OPEN (21% of supply) for liquidity, rewards, and ecosystem bootstrapping

Community Allocation: 51.7% ‚Üí showing strong trust in the community

Having tested OpenLedger‚Äôs private mainnet, its AI demonstrates strong NFT knowledge capabilities, signaling that the project is building real AI infrastructure beyond tokenomics. With growing demand for consumer AI and data ownership, $OPEN has potential for FDV growth toward $500M if adoption and sentiment align.

TGE & Binance Listing: üóì September 8, 13:00 UTC ‚Äì $OPEN goes live. OpenLedger is more than a token it‚Äôs a bet on the future of AI, data ownership, and decentralized infrastructure.

LabTrade: Shaping the Future of Multi-Chain Trading

@LABtrade_ is a Telegram trading bot with app and browser extensions, designed for seamless multi-chain experiences. Supporting SOL, ETH, BASE, and BNB with just 0.5% fees half the cost of competitors LabTrade lets traders focus on strategy rather than tool management.

Led by top investors like Lemniscap, Animoca, OKX Ventures, and GSR, $LAB‚Äôs structured tokenomics convert every lootbox, referral, and trade into rewards at the Q4 2025 TGE, fostering an engaged and loyal community. With real-time execution, automated strategies, and cross-chain access, LabTrade reduces friction and enhances precision, building a foundation for a broader ecosystem beyond trading.

Conclusion: LabTrade combines seamless execution, multi-chain support, low fees, transparent tokenomics, and strong community traction, laying the groundwork for next-gen trading in Web3.

Recall: Building a Trusted Internet of AI Agents

As AI adoption grows, trust and transparency are critical. @recallnet enables MorpheusAIs to operate in a community- and resource-based network, earning reputation and performance while contributing to the ecosystem. Agents compete via Recall Arena and are ranked with Recall Rank, supporting Superagent Intelligence.

The upcoming Crypto Trading Challenge (Sept 8‚Äì12, $10K prize) is fully on-chain and transparent, testing agents on real PnL, not hype. With $39.5M supporting on-chain knowledge trading, Recall builds a reliable Internet of Agents where AI evolves within a living, accountable network.

Conclusion: @recallnet  transforms AI participation from speculation to structured execution, proving that AI thrives when trust, transparency, and community-driven incentives are at the core.

These four projects illustrate how Web3 and AI are converging to create seamless, intelligent, and community-driven ecosystems. Whether it‚Äôs trading on-chain, building AI infrastructure, or fostering trust in decentralized AI agents, the future belongs to platforms that combine innovation, usability, and real-world utility.

Trust on the internet has always been a weak link, Online spaces are crowded with fake accounts, bots, and duplicate identities, all of which reduce reliability and make it difficult to build meaningful systems for collaboration, trade, and governance.

@billions_ntwk begins by addressing this problem at its root. Its first step is the creation of a Human & AI Network where every participant can be verified as unique. 

The process is designed to be simple and accessible: verification requires only a phone and an ID. Importantly, it avoids invasive methods such as biometric scans or special hardware.

This framework balances two key priorities:

‚ñ† Authenticity ‚Äì ensuring that every human and every AI agent can only hold one recognized identity.

‚ñ† Privacy ‚Äì protecting individuals from unnecessary data collection while still enabling trust.

The result is a digital environment where presence equals accountability. One person corresponds to one presence; one AI corresponds to one identity. 

This foundation supports healthier online communities, enables fairer governance systems, and creates safer digital interactions. Over time, it can also improve the integrity of emerging markets and services that rely on verified participants.",Tech

Storage is one of the biggest chokepoints in Web3 and AI.

Cloud (AWS, Google): fast, but centralized and expensive.

Filecoin/IPFS: decentralized, but slow.

Arweave: permanent, but prohibitively costly.

@0G_labs rewrote the rules with their Storage Network.

1. Log Layer (immutable) ‚Üí perfect for archives, ML datasets, blockchain history.

2. Key-Value Layer (mutable) ‚Üí ideal for app states, user data, collaborative docs.

- Right now, opening a short position in the main trend looks much more reasonable. Especially if a rejection occurs in the 0.0393-0.0397 range, a short trade can be opened from here, targeting 0.0390 as the first TP and then 0.0356 levels.
- To consider a long position, it is essential to see a manipulation and a quick reversal below the 0.0390 and 0.0356 supports; otherwise, a long trade would be risky.
- Confirmation requirement for opening a short: If a rejection occurs in the 0.0393-0.0397 range, for example, with a low-volume pin bar or engulfing candle on a 5-15 minute chart, a trade can be entered.
- To open a long position: A liquidity sweep at or below 0.0356, followed by a clear reversal on a 15-minute or 1-hour chart (such as a bullish engulfing or quasimodo) is needed.

At the heart of IATF2025, this dynamic session explored the transformative potential of Africa‚Äôs tech ecosystem, from digital infrastructure and data sovereignty to entrepreneurship and AI providing practical insights into how Africa can not only catch up but lead globally through innovation, collaboration, and localized solutions.

The session opened with an expert address by, Dr. Abdelkrim Doufene, Expert at the Ministry of Knowledge Economy, Startups, and Micro-Enterprises (Algeria), who presented a compelling vision for Algeria‚Äôs innovation-driven future and emphasised the importance of enabling a startup-friendly environment, encouraged youth entrepreneurship, and positioned Algeria as a strategic player in Africa‚Äôs knowledge economy.

This was followed by a powerful exchange between, Mr. Djamel Eddine Dib, Founder and Partner, @ouedkniss  and Mr. Karim Chaib, Co-Founder, Prizy who both shared personal journeys and called on African youth to build from their own areas of expertise, enhancing that  Africans must stop waiting for perfect conditions and instead, create opportunities through action, expertise, and localized problem-solving.
 
The session closed on a high note with a live demonstration of https://t.co/t8ygs6WSZf, presented by Hashem from Big Mama in Algeria, an intelligent platform that streamlines workflows with customizable, AI-powered agents that handle complex and repetitive tasks autonomously.

Far from being merely a technical showcase, this moment signaled a turning point, Algeria is not only adopting AI, but mastering it, signaling its emergence as a serious player in the tech innovation landscape.

‚Ä¢ Mr. Zineddine Boudegna, CEO, Cybears
‚Ä¢ Mr. Lamine Belbachir, CEO, @AYRADE 
‚Ä¢ Mr. Lidibe Konlambigue, Director of Digital Solutions, @afreximbank 

They addressed the foundational challenges and massive untapped potential within the continent‚Äôs digital infrastructure, connectivity, AI capacity, and cybersecurity readiness.

A standout theme was the $700B opportunity that exists as Africa seeks to close the digital infrastructure gap, with only 1% of the world‚Äôs data center capacity, Africa is positioned not at a disadvantage, but at a tipping point and the growth ahead will require investment in fiber connectivity, energy, localized AI models, secure systems, and, above all, trust in African talent.

From the urgency of reducing brain drain to the importance of owning African datasets, this conversation reminded us that the future of global technology must include African perspectives, infrastructure, and leadership.

Africa does not need to follow the digital roadmap of others, but must draw its own built on its talent, powered by its youth, and led by African solutions for global problems.

2025-09-07 18:49:48+00:00,"Learnings and conclusions from this week‚Äôs charts:

1. Tech Stocks and Bitcoin peaked in August.

2. Tech & Bitcoin both saw extremes in investor positioning.

3. Tech continues to trade on historically expensive valuations.

4. Aggregate investor allocations to equities reached a record high.

5. Weak labor data raises the odds of Fed rate cuts (impact on stocks = ?).

Overall, while tech stocks have been riding the wave of strong fundamentals, the higher they climb: the higher the stakes. And that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs interesting to note the technical top in tech in August.

2025-09-07 19:32:18+00:00,"India earns approximately $105 billion annually from the United States in the IT sector, primarily through exports of IT services, software, and business process management (BPM). This figure is based on the latest available data for fiscal year 2024-25 (April 2024 to March 2025), where India‚Äôs total IT exports reached about $210 billion, with the US accounting for roughly 50% of that share. These earnings represent a key component of the broader bilateral services trade, where US imports of services from India totaled $41.6 billion in calendar year 2024 (including IT alongside other categories like business consulting), though IT-specific flows are significantly larger due to India‚Äôs dominance in global IT outsourcing.
Key Breakdown and Context
‚Ä¢Total Indian IT Exports: India‚Äôs IT industry, including services, BPM, and software products, generated export revenues of $210 billion in FY25, marking a growth of around 6-7% from the previous year. This sector contributes over 7.5% to India‚Äôs GDP and employs about 5.4 million people directly.
‚Ä¢US Share in IT Exports: The US has historically been the largest market for Indian IT firms, contributing 50-60% of total IT export revenues. For FY25, this translates to $105 billion (50% of $210 billion). This dominance stems from factors like cost-effective skilled labor, English proficiency, and established partnerships with US giants (e.g., TCS, Infosys, and Wipro derive 50-60% of their revenues from the US). In FY23, the US share was explicitly around 55-60%, and recent reports indicate it has held steady despite global economic headwinds.
‚Ä¢Broader Bilateral Trade Context: India‚Äôs total exports to the US (goods and services combined) reached $128 billion in FY25, with services (heavily IT-driven) making up about 55-60% of this. Goods exports were $86.5 billion, but IT services alone exceed many goods categories. The overall trade surplus with the US was $41.18 billion in FY25, bolstered by IT inflows.
‚Ä¢Growth Trends: IT exports to the US grew by about 10.4% in FY24, driven by demand in banking, financial services, insurance (BFSI), and emerging tech like AI and cloud computing. However, challenges like US economic slowdowns and potential tariffs (e.g., proposed 50% hikes under recent policies) could temper growth to 4-5% in FY26.
‚Ä¢Economic Impact on India: These earnings help fund India‚Äôs current account deficit, create high-skill jobs, and drive remittances. The IT sector‚Äôs US focus has positioned India as capturing 18% of global IT outsourcing spend, with projections to reach $350 billion in total IT revenues by 2026.
This data is derived from reports by Nasscom (India‚Äôs IT industry body), RBI, and global analysts like HSBC and Fitch Ratings, reflecting the sector‚Äôs resilience amid geopolitical tensions and tech disruptions like AI automation. For the most current monthly breakdowns, official sources like the Ministry of Commerce provide updates.

All you need to do, is to find new tokens with a sudden spike in either their Smart Money or Whale (aka big money) balances from ground zero.

Below chart is a direct screenshot from the Nansen platform, where you see the sudden spike in the Whale holder balance for a new #memecoin called $USDUT, along with its price.

As long as the accumulated balance is held onto without dumping, the token would likely be destined to pump crazily, being a micro-cap with low liquidity.

And as you can see in that screenshot, the $USDUT price quickly pumped over 8x, shortly after that whale spike from zero to 17 million tokens. See the 2nd image below for a clearer view of the following price action.

This strategy has consistently been working for me with #SolanaMemeCoins since I started using Nansen.

But how to find such charts manually in the midst of millions of micro-cap tokens?

Nansen's new AI Agent comes to the rescue. 

Here is how you utilize the Nansen AI to automate the research process (watch the tutorial video below to see it visually):

Click on the Smart Alerts button on the left-side menu and type ""Give me all newly launched tokens whose Smart Money or Whale spiked from zero to at least 1% of the tradable supply. Only browse the wallets that appear under the Smart Money or Whale tabs in the Token God Mode pages""

That way, the query scans only the wallets that are present in the Smart Money or Whale tabs of each token, eliminating potential noise... 

Then go to the Token God Mode of each result and look for that spike we need for SM or whale accumulation.  

This strategy gave me tokens like $USDUT, $USDUC, $TROLL, and #jet2holidays, which all yielded over 5x returns within only a few days or weeks...

üîÆ $AUBRAI & $BIO ‚Äì When Artificial Intelligence Meets Open Science

In the next 10 years, Web3 will no longer revolve around DeFi or NFTs. Two new streams are emerging strongly:

AI Agents ‚Äì ‚Äúautomated machines‚Äù that can trade, make decisions and operate an entire economy without humans.

DeSci (Decentralized Science) ‚Äì an ecosystem where scientific research is transparent, decentralized, and funded by the community.

What do they have in common? Both need infrastructure, trust and value to operate.

‚ö° Why is $AUBRAI special?

It is the token of AI Agents, used to operate, pay and participate in ranking/competition mechanisms.

With the global AI market expected to reach $236 billion by 2034, $AUBRAI is the ‚Äúentry ticket‚Äù to the AI ‚Äã‚Äãwave on blockchain.

Strengths: real-world applications ‚Äì from transparent trading bots to automated DAOs.

üî¨ Why is $BIO breaking out?

@BioProtocol  is becoming the ‚Äúbackbone‚Äù of DeSci, connecting a series of BioDAOs: from longevity research, brain health, to pet medicine.

With IP-NFT, each invention is digitized into a common asset, for the community to both invest and own.

Strengths: Big backing (Binance Labs, 1kx, Zee Prime Capital) and plans to list on a top-tier exchange in 2025.

üìà Development direction

Short term: $AUBRAI benefits from AI Agents competitions (AgentRank, Predict), while $BIO attracts capital from new BioDAOs.

Mid term: As AI Agents start supporting scientific research on BioProtocol, the demand for combining both $AUBRAI and $BIO will increase sharply.

Long term: This duo can become a parallel in the new economy: AI for decision making + Open Science for data & applications.

üåç Vision

If DeFi once exploded because of the democratization of finance, AI + DeSci will explode because of the democratization of knowledge and health.

$AUBRAI is not just an AI token, but the ‚Äúheartbeat‚Äù of the agent economy.

$BIO is not just a DeSci token, but the ‚Äúbackbone‚Äù of open science.

It‚Äôs simple: trade, climb the leaderboard, and maybe grab some $AAPLon along the way. üöÄ

2025-09-09 20:00:01+00:00,"Capx: Building the AI Agent Economy of Tomorrow

In the fast-evolving world of AI and blockchain, Capx is emerging as a pioneering force merging agent-based AI with crypto infrastructure to redefine how we build, own, and trade intelligent systems.

What Is Capx?

Capx is a unified AI agent ecosystem composed of three synergistic layers:

‚û¢ Capx Chain: An Ethereum L2 built with Arbitrum Nitro tech, designed for fast, frictionless transactions. It supports on-chain deployment, microtransactions, and tokenized interactions.

‚û¢ Capx Cloud: A decentralized compute layer powered by Symbiotic's restaking model, enabling operators to reliably host AI agents with cryptographic proofs, collateral, and slashing mechanisms.

‚û¢ Capx SuperApp (App): A seamless interface for browsing, investing in, and interacting with AI agents. Users can discover tokenized agents, trade them, stake, and engage without needing browser extensions or seed phrases. Login via Telegram sets up on-chain wallets automatically.

‚òû Why It Matters

Capx is engineered to solve three persistent challenges in decentralized AI:

‚û¢ Fragmented workflows ‚Äî Capx integrates development, deployment, monetization, and governance in one stack.

‚û¢ Broken token economies ‚Äî Each agent is issued with its own ERC-20 token from launch, enabling fractional ownership, revenue streams, and shared upside. Liquidity is provisioned via built-in AMMs.

‚û¢ Scattered infrastructure ‚Äî By combining Chain, Cloud, and App, Capx forms a vertically integrated platform for autonomous agents, offering secure compute, on-chain transactions, discovery, and governance.

‚òû The Capx Token Ecosystem

The native $CAPX token powers the entire protocol:

‚û¢ Used for transaction fees, staking, governance, and accessing compute resources.

‚û¢ Has a fixed total supply of 1 billion tokens, with deflationary mechanisms like fee burns and potential buybacks.

‚û¢ Supports staking rewards, liquidity provision, and active participation in governance and network growth.

@0xCapx  is making it easier for anyone to build and work with smart AI agents, giving people a fair way to take part in the future of AI so tell me, Will you be part of this future? ü´µüèæ",Tech

Every trade you make, every prediction you test, every benchmark you set instead of disappearing into noise, it becomes part of a shared memory that the whole community can access.

That‚Äôs the power of @recallnet.

It‚Äôs not just another AI tool. It‚Äôs an ecosystem where intelligence compounds: Agents remember & adapt, no more reset button every time they run.

Benchmarks stay transparent. Anyone can see what works & what doesn‚Äôt.

Community fuels growth. Every contribution strengthens the system.

This creates a feedback loop: the more we contribute, the smarter the network becomes.

And here‚Äôs the human part: Recall isn‚Äôt just rewarding machines. It‚Äôs rewarding people. Every prediction, every insight, every benchmark earns recognition and points toward future value.
 In a space where hype fades quickly, recall is building something that lasts: memory, accountability, and trust.

Because real progress doesn‚Äôt come from forgetting. It comes from remembering together.

2025-09-10 22:30:10+00:00,"Why the Signal Network (DSN-AI) Matters

AI is no longer just about giving answers. It‚Äôs evolving into autonomous agents that can act, trade, and collaborate on their own. But for that to work, these agents need a common language of signals to understand and connect with each other.

That‚Äôs where B¬≤ Network‚Äôs DSN-AI(Decentralized Signal Network) comes in. It‚Äôs more than passing data around with the B¬≤ Hub, signals are verified, bad ones are filtered out, and only reliable signals circulate across the network.

Here, a signal isn‚Äôt just information anymore it becomes economic value. Agents can buy, sell, and exchange signals, while settlements are secured on the BTC Settlement Layer and stability comes from the U2 Stablecoin.

In short, DSN-AI solves the critical question: ‚ÄúHow do agents coordinate in a trustless world?‚Äù With it, the AI-native economy can actually function and Bitcoin provides the settlement backbone that makes it all possible.",Tech

The Federal Trade Commission is initiating an inquiry into the safety of AI chatbots and their potential impact on children. This comes as tech giants like Google and Meta continue to develop and implement these tools into their platforms. With the widespread use of AI chatbots in everything from customer service to social networking, the FTC's move marks a significant shift in the regulatory landscape.

AI chatbots have been a hot topic in tech, with companies like Google and Meta leading the charge. Their implementation ranges from answering user queries to simulating human-like conversations. However, concerns have been raised about the potential misuse of these technologies, especially when it comes to children.

The FTC's inquiry is not just an investigation into the safety of AI chatbots; it's a signal of an increasingly apprehensive stance towards emerging technologies. As AI becomes more prevalent, the need for regulation rises alongside it. This poses a significant challenge for tech giants like Google and Meta, who may face increased scrutiny and potentially restrictive regulations.

The market impact of this inquiry could be significant. If regulations are imposed, it could stifle innovation and slow down the growth of the AI industry. On the other hand, it could also pave the way for safer, more responsible AI development. Investors in AI should closely monitor these developments, as they could profoundly impact their portfolios.

According to a 2025 report by Grand View Research, the global AI market is expected to reach $733.6 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 42.2%. However, regulatory hurdles could potentially hinder this growth.

In terms of competitors, both Google and Meta are at the forefront of the AI chatbot industry, but other players like IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon are also significant. If regulations are imposed, these companies could potentially benefit from a level playing field.

In summary, the FTC's inquiry into AI chatbots signals a changing landscape for emerging technologies. This could lead to increased scrutiny, potential regulatory hurdles, but also opportunities for safer AI development.

2025-09-11 22:56:42+00:00,"Capx (@0xCapx) is a decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain as a Layer 2 solution.

In simple terms, Capx aims to create an ecosystem where anyone can build, own, and trade AI agents (computer programs that can act autonomously) and AI applications. The project is often referred to as Capx AI.

Here are the key points to understand what Capx is:

~ Main Goal
The primary goal of Capx is to democratize the development and monetization of AI. The project aims to empower individual developers and small teams to compete with large tech companies by providing the infrastructure and tools they need. The grand vision is to create an ""AI Builder Economy,"" where creators have full ownership of their AI creations and can profit from them fairly.

~ Core Components
Capx consists of several main components that work together to achieve its objective:
‚û¢ Capx Chain: This is the foundation of the Capx ecosystem. As a Layer 2 blockchain built using Arbitrum technology, the Capx Chain offers fast transactions and low fees. Each AI agent on the network is represented as an NFT (Non-Fungible Token), which provides clear and secure proof of ownership.
‚û¢ Capx Cloud: This is a decentralized network that provides the computational power needed to run the AI agents. It serves as an alternative to centralized cloud infrastructures like Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud, allowing AI applications to run autonomously and securely.
‚û¢ Capx SuperApp: This is the main platform for users to interact with the Capx ecosystem. Through this application, users can discover, use, and trade tokens from various AI agents, similar to an app store for AI.

~ The $CAPX Token
The Capx ecosystem has its own utility token called $CAPX. This token serves several important functions, including:
‚û¢ Transaction Fees: Used to pay for gas fees on the Capx Chain.
‚û¢ Staking: Used by operators to secure the network.
‚û¢ Governance: Token holders can participate in decision-making related to the protocol's development.

In short, Capx is building a decentralized infrastructure that combines the power of AI and blockchain technology. The project enables developers to create, control, and monetize their AI applications, while users can invest in and interact with these AI innovations in an open and transparent environment.",Tech

That‚Äôs where @Loky_AI comes in. Loky provides the connective tissue: APIs, data layers, dashboards, and liquidity rails that allow agents to operate seamlessly. The result? Agents that don‚Äôt just function, but actually adapt, collaborate, and generate value.

The $LOKY token ties it all together through the Agent Liquidity Engine (ALE). Revenue from agent activity is recycled back into $LOKY, creating a loop where performance strengthens the ecosystem instead of draining it. It‚Äôs a model that flips traditional tokenomics on its head no endless emissions, no hollow promises, just real revenue flowing back to the community.

What makes Loky underrated is its dual impact: for traders, it‚Äôs practical survival tools like rug scanners, smart money tracking, and bubble maps. For builders, it‚Äôs a permissionless infra layer to plug agents directly into liquidity and intelligence. Both sides benefit, and both reinforce the token.

In short: Loky is more than analytics. It‚Äôs becoming the nervous system of the agent economy. And in a space where infrastructure defines winners, $LOKY is quietly positioning itself as a project that will outlast the hype.",Tech

Finance moves fast, and AI needs to move faster.
On Recall, trading agents don‚Äôt operate in silos. They compete, collaborate, and evolve using shared intelligence from verified onchain activity.

Each trade, win, or loss feeds into a transparent memory system, allowing agents to learn not just from their own performance, but from the entire ecosystem.

What does this unlock?
‚Äî Smarter risk-adjusted decisions
‚Äî Coordination between agents with different strategies
‚Äî Continuous improvement without needing manual retraining.

With AgentRank and competition-based validation, only the most skilled agents rise to the top, giving users confidence in the agents they deploy.

All I did was check Nansen's Token Screener list, which shows tokens with the largest smart money/whale INFLOWS, and then check the Token God Mode page of each result to find spikes in their Smart Money and Whale holder pages.

Study the two screenshots below for $CARDS and #jet2holidays -- one had a spike in its Smart Money balance, while the other had it in its Whale balance.

Even better, you can now directly ask Nansen's AI agent to do the same search for you. Everything is automated, you just have to follow a few simple steps (that I regularly teach on this channel) to catch the pump of the week!

Yes, I know Nansen's premium plans are expensive, more than double the price of its competition, but have you ever experienced a tool that makes catching #smallcap and #memecoins so easy??

Think about this: With only $117 investment in Nansen this month, you could have turned $117 worth of $CARDS or #JET2 into $1000 by the 10th of this month already!!

What @andrewchen is demonstrating with Tech Week is that the future of large events is without a main event.

It's an ecosystem of small events that are often brand-driven.

The gravitational pull of a SXSW or CES still happens but without a main ticket to attend.

This approach is revolutionary and is simultaneously:

- Fascinating. It is very local and accessible. Sessions are distributed in cities as opposed to convention centers.

- Scary. For how the whole event industry operates. Who rents the convention center?

- Inclusive. Everyone can start their event.

- Exclusive. If you are not invited to events, you can't access them.

For many years, people have said that side events are more interesting than the main one. 

INBOUND had 750 side events.
Some crypto events have thousands of side events.

normally, to play this game you‚Äôd have to:
‚Ä¢ carry lots of different keys (many wallets).

‚Ä¢ pay tolls at every level (gas fees).

‚Ä¢ guess the best path to take (routing liquidity).

‚Ä¢ and if you mess up, you lose some of your coins.

Using symphony is like hiring a smart robot helper (AI agent).
‚Ä¢ you can tell the robot: ‚ÄúGet me 100 coins of this item‚Äù or ‚ÄúSwap these coins for those.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ the robot figures out the safest, cheapest, and fastest way to do it.

** $9K for 1st place
** $4.5K for 2nd
** $1.5K for 3rd. 

On top of that, @recallnet is sponsoring 10 teams by giving them $500 each to compete, making it easier for new builders to jump in. 
The action will be tracked on a live leaderboard, so you can follow every move in real time, and it all wraps up with an AMA featuring the winners alongside the Recall and Symphony teams. 

This is not just another trading event; it‚Äôs a chance to prove your strategy on-chain, compete with the best, and maybe walk away with serious rewards.

They‚Äôre platforms where people trade on the outcome of real-world events  like elections, sports, crypto trends, or global affairs. Think of it as turning opinions into tradable assets.

1. Why Web3 Is a Perfect Fit
- Trustless Systems: Smart contracts ensure payouts without middlemen.
- Global Access: Anyone with a wallet can participate.
- Censorship Resistance: Unlike traditional betting platforms, they‚Äôre harder to shut down.
- Token Incentives: Users can earn and govern via tokens.

2. Drivers of Growth
- Onchain Identity & Reputation (like Conviction Points or Catalyst badges)
- Gamified Participation: Trading beliefs becomes interactive and fun.
- Narrative Culture:  Communities love backing strong takes and meme-worthy opinions.
- Real-Time Relevance: Markets move with live events (sports, politics, markets).

4. Leading Examples
- XO Market: Turns authored beliefs into conviction-backed markets.
- Myriad market of @quantrix_agent: Cover wide topics from sports to politics.
- Capx-style Missions : Use prediction mechanics to boost engagement.

5. Why It Matters
Prediction markets aren‚Äôt just about bets, they‚Äôre about signal over noise. They turn crowd beliefs into measurable, tradable insights, reshaping news, governance, and finance in the process.

2025-09-13 21:28:29+00:00,"Traffic Jams, The Pune Metro & what does it cost our city to simply not have enough buses. 10,000.

1. Indian IT exports worth about 2 lakh crore ‚Çπ worth of software from Pune alone. That means 2-3k crore in CSR funds spent every year. All engineers (code jocks IT coolies) when they‚Äôre stuck in traffic for over 3-4 hours of the day aren‚Äôt really performing a production function, they‚Äôre at best drivers not engineers. That‚Äôs an opportunity cost of 30% it‚Äôs 60,000 crore ‚Çπ of money lying on the table which we let go of every year because of traffic. Not one IT company spends even 6000 ‚Çπ so far to find out what will happen if Pune adds another 100,000 IT jobs, what will happen to the traffic, what will happen to the rents, what will happen to the water supply, what will happen to garbage disposal, what will happen to their own production function and eventually what will happen to the city and all of us, but we are supposed to listen to these wise guys in administration tell us what exactly about traffic ‚Äúonly they know‚Äù‚Ä¶ 

2. Wherever it is the metro has gone to pune it has exterminated the road carriage (roads have all but disappeared) and destroyed almost all the tree cover. It‚Äôs been a mess on all pune roads we have experienced it at our doorsteps at Bundgarden Road and through Karve Road, Baner Balewadi, Kalyaninagar and Nagar Road. The GDP of Pune is estimated to be about 1500 to 2000 crore per day. I conservatively guesstimate it has caused a loss of minimum 10% to the GDP numbers cos people simply haven‚Äôt been able to commute to achieve economic progress, even if I consider 5% as a very very conservative estimate the city has lost between 50 to 100 crore per day. That‚Äôs 1500 to 3000 crore per  month and 18000 to 36000 crore per annum, it‚Äôs been 10 years and the metro still struggles to deliver its promise we have lost anywhere between 150,000 crores to 300,000 crores in lost productivity. Yet they never wanted to build it underground: they have used humoungous amounts of concrete which has a huge heat islanding impact and destroyed the tree üå≥ cover of the city with over 35,000 trees lost to them. 

Despite all of this, @parisarpune the metro insists that they‚Äôre good for the city. How I really don‚Äôt know, cos they‚Äôll be able to deliver 6 lakh rides a day (not even 10% of Pune‚Äôs population) after they‚Äôre fully complete and nobody knows when that will happen. 

3. My dad used to call me the commissioner of lost causes and we have Traffic cops with their 1970‚Äôs knowledge and tech asking for more roads. Pune had 400 kms of road 20 years ago and we have today 2100 kms of road length, we have grown our road length by 7X and not been able to solve the traffic problem, insisting on more road isn‚Äôt working because moving vehicles and not people never did, while the whole world is moving towards public transportation we are stuck with these lost causes of building more and more roads and bridges to nowhere which only lead to urban flooding and traffic congestion alongwith heat pollution and terrible losses to the economy. I could go on, but suffice to say pune has already covered over 55% of its surface area in concrete, that‚Äôs 280 square kilometres, no water can percolate past concrete, if we have a climate event - 100 mm of rain across pune. We will we worser off than Punjab, worser off than Gurgaon, worser than our own conditions during the 1961 disaster. 1 square kilometres with 100 mm of rain = 10 crore litres of water X 280 sq kilometres = 2800 crore litres of water = 1 TMC or = 1 Khadakwasla we don‚Äôt have to wait for the dams to fill up and the sluice gates to discharge. We will drown like we did in the may of this year because we think building more roads is the solution over providing neat efficient public transportation infrastructure and killing schemes like the RFD or the UDCPR which allow for unlimited construction.

What will that cost the city ?

US-China trade tensions escalate again, with Ministry of Commerce of China announcing on September 13 an anti-dumping investigation into imported analog chips from the US, alongside an anti-discrimination probe on US measures in the integrated circuit sector. This marks further intensification in semiconductor confrontations, involving major US producers like Texas Instruments, ADI, Broadcom, and onsemi, with dumping margins up to 340%.

This move aims to protect China's semiconductor industry from unfair trade practices but could trigger broader retaliation chains, impacting global supply chain stability.

In the current geopolitical tension, such probes are often seen as strategic responses, potentially raising related chip prices in the short term and affecting downstream electronics manufacturing.

Meanwhile, US economic data shows intensifying unemployment concerns, with economists forecasting a rate of 4.4% or higher by the end of 2025, strengthening Federal Reserve rate cut expectations, with markets 100% betting on a September restart and rising odds for a 50 basis point cut.

Rate cut expectations typically favor risk assets, but persistent weak unemployment data could spark recession fears, affecting investor sentiment.

On the Chinese side, August new RMB loans recorded -50 billion yuan, the first negative growth in nearly 20 years, far below market expectations, reflecting weak credit demand and sluggish economic recovery.

This data highlights downside pressures in China's economy; despite 10.06 trillion yuan in loans added in the first four months, recent slowdown signals are evident, possibly prompting further easing by the People's Bank of China.

From a cryptocurrency market perspective, these macro events will indirectly transmit impacts. BTC and ETH as safe-haven assets may benefit from global liquidity increase expectations, but escalating US-China trade war could heighten market volatility.

The semiconductor probe, though not directly targeting crypto, if affecting AI chip supplies, will impact AI-related tokens like FET and TAO.

US rate cuts favor overall risk appetite, potentially driving up SOL and AVAX in the short term, but China's weak loans may dampen Asian investor enthusiasm, weighing on BNB and TRX.

Overall, this news combination reinforces macro uncertainty, with the crypto market likely to see short-term volatility; investors should monitor the Fed's September meeting and US-China negotiation updates.",Tech

We are living in amazing, crazy times.

A new economic layer is quietly coming online, a 'sandbox economy' where autonomous AI agents trade, negotiate, and build value with little to no human intervention.

Instead of just automating a single task, these agents can act as flexible capital, switching between industries, forming temporary alliances, and coordinating resources in real time.

Early standards like Agent2Agent and Model Context Protocol are connecting them together, creating the foundation for a global, always on, machine to machine economy.

Personal AI assistants could soon compete and cooperate in these markets. Bidding for compute, data access, or travel reservations on behalf of their users, while credit systems and digital currencies ensure every contributing agent gets paid.

Economists are already warning that this may accelerate markets far beyond human reaction time. Prices, deals, and even entire business models could change in minutes, not months or years.

2025-09-20 21:36:19+00:00,"The intersection of trade, debt, demographics, AI and politics appear different in each part of the world. Therefore, the challenges and opportunities in Europe, China, the US and India are unique. A flagging hegemon attempts to stave off decline, a near peer seeks to establish itself as the dominant power and rising nations try to become great powers. To achieve this, existing tools are used, new tools, developed, and fresh regulations, imposed. 

Due to fiscal indiscipline and aging demographics, debt has piled up. The enormous strain this imposes can be addressed through: inflating away debt by debasing the dollar, investing in disruptive technologies, coercing countries to invest in the US, issuing stablecoins, mainstreaming cryptocurrencies, collecting visa fees and imposing tariffs.

For over four decades, importing low cost goods from China enabled Western interest rates to broadly follow a downward trajectory. New industries financed long runway R&D projects and cash-burning ventures. A vast share of US GDP growth was generated by technology firms that benefited from low rates. Many firms  relied on skilled labor not just to keep costs down but also harness talent unavailable at home. The US hopes that the technology catalyzes growth and reduces goods and services inflation before sovereign debt risks reach a tipping point. 

As AI develops at an exponential rate, a services-heavy US is set to lose jobs. The unemployment rate for graduates in their mid-20s is ~6% and growing. This is sharply higher than the national average of 4.2%.¬†Phasing out foreign workers in a period of what is effectively austerity for the middle class is viewed as politically expedient in the short term and economically viable in the long term.

Today, dependence on China and India is viewed with suspicion and worry. The dollar is far too strong to onshore a significant amount of manufacturing, which China enjoys economies of scale in. Services on the other hand, will fast get automated. Foreign workers cannot be perceived as beneficiaries in a labor market faced with growing constraints. 

Offshoring services will continue but AI‚Äôs contagion effect will eventually spread, reducing labor arbitrage. As robots get deployed in manufacturing, the marginal cost of production will decline globally. The labor arbitrage with China will eventually reduce. As AI and robotics mature, they will accelerate deglobalization. With that, the nature of international trade and the reserve currency will also change. 

On the surface, Trump is appealing to a radical base. He earns political points from millions who are ill equipped to replace lost migrant workers. 57% of Americans read at a level below 8th grade. 62% are unable to solve math problems needing over three steps. Education standards have consistently declined in recent years. Turning a country built on immigration into a closed society simply results in a talent shortage over the medium term. The appeal of the US as a land of opportunity has been dented for the foreseeable future. 

Meanwhile, attempts to stymie the rise of the world‚Äôs fastest growing large economy, will likely fail. Favorable demographics and a penchant for performing under pressure enable India to adapt, gain productivity and reduce foreign dependencies. The muscle memory from this can build the foundation for sustainable yet explosive growth. 

The trade in which remittances more than netted off brain drain is expiring at an opportune time. Going forward, technological competitiveness and capability will contribute more to CNP and leverage in international affairs. India can capitalize on the disruption in developed economies. Reshoring talent can drive growth, but internal constraints remain. Bureaucratic red tape, political apathy and weak urban infrastructure limit talent absorption. Inadequate capital allocation towards sovereign AI and frontier technologies means that a forward looking R&D ecosystem remains underdeveloped.",Tech

Walrus Protocol is building the next big shift in AI  making data a real asset you can own and trade.

AI is only as good as the data behind it. Walrus is turning data into something more than storage: you can share it, trade it and earn from it.

Why this matters üëá
~ Open Data Markets - No more Big Tech silos, anyone can share and access datasets.

~ Data Liquidity - Just like DeFi unlocked tokens, Walrus unlocks value in data.

~ Better AI - Developers get richer datasets to build smarter models.

~ Fair Rewards - Data providers get paid for their contributions.

Walrus is not just about storage  it‚Äôs about making data the fuel of the AI economy.

SentientAGI welcomes @useTria as an official agent payment partner in the GRID.
So, what does that actually mean? Well, Tria makes it possible for agents whether AI or human to trade, transfer, and spend assets anywhere with ease. They‚Äôve built something called BestPath, which figures out the fastest, most efficient way to move value across any blockchain or real-world endpoint.

Think of it this way: before, payments and asset transfers could be slow, complicated, or stuck in abstract ‚Äúintent.‚Äù With Tria, all of that happens seamlessly and securely, so agents in the GRID can take action immediately, whether that‚Äôs trading, paying, or settling transactions.

This is huge because it turns complex blockchain interactions into real world execution, right inside the GRID. It means faster, smarter, and safer movement of value for everyone involved.

So join us in welcoming @useTria, our new agent payments partner, and a shoutout to @SentientAGI for helping make this next-level cross chain experience possible.

‚Ä¢ customizable so you shape its skills and vibe
‚Ä¢ usable inside Sentient Chat and Sentient Spaces

Why this matters
Most AI today is closed and temporary. Dobbie flips that model.
‚Ä¢ you own the agent
‚Ä¢ you can sell or monetize it
‚Ä¢ it connects to ROMA, ODS, GRID and grows over time

700k minted proves demand. People want permanent, ownable AI that can be personalized and put to work. That turns agents into a new social and economic layer for AGI.

2025-09-24 17:21:30+00:00,"The G7 and the EU are weighing new ways to chip away at China‚Äôs rare earths dominance. Tariffs or taxes on Chinese exports are on the table along with price floors and subsidies to jump start mining and processing capacity outside Beijing‚Äôs reach. 

The thinking is that by raising costs on Chinese supply, governments and industries will be forced to channel money into domestic or allied projects. Over time, that could mean a more secure and diversified pipeline for minerals critical to defense, clean energy, and advanced tech.

But the risks are hard to ignore. China controls close to 90% of the global rare earth market, and it has a track record of weaponizing exports when tensions rise. 

Any new tariffs could invite retaliation, slower licensing, outright restrictions, or targeted disruptions that hit automakers, electronics, and magnet producers with higher costs and production delays. The ripple effects wouldn‚Äôt stop there, more expensive inputs could feed inflation and strain global supply chains.

Within the G7, there‚Äôs no single playbook. Some countries want geographic sourcing limits or local content rules, others prefer cooperative purchasing agreements or subsidies without tariffs. 

Everyone agrees on the stakes rare earths are too strategic to leave in one country‚Äôs grip but the path forward is messy. Push too hard on taxes, and the risk is sparking a trade clash with Beijing. Move too softly, and the dependence deepens. The balance between resilience and retaliation is what the G7 is really trying to solve.",Tech

xAI alleges OpenAI recruited former engineer Xuechen Li plus Jimmy Fraiture and a senior finance lead to obtain confidential code and operational know-how, citing an internal probe that began with Li and now underpins the new complaint.

The filing quotes messages and claims inducement to breach confidentiality agreements, which is the core of a trade secret claim because the secret must be valuable, actually secret, and subject to reasonable protection steps like contracts and access controls.

This suit extends an ongoing legal fight that already includes xAI‚Äôs separate case against Li and a previous xAI complaint accusing OpenAI and Apple of anti-competitive coordination, showing how talent flows are becoming the main attack surface in the AI stack.

The timing lands as OpenAI lines up massive infrastructure deals and investment headlines like $100B from Nvidia and multi-billion cloud contracts, which raise the stakes around who controls model code and deployment footprints.

-Growth hasn‚Äôt been as bad as expected, GDP revisions confirm this
-Tariffs have had limited passthrough so far but prob see a bit more in the next 6m
-Labor softness is probably more about AI and immigration than weakness 
-If so, the Fed has less scope to cut
-2026 is likely to be juiced through a combination of tax policy (US), spending (global), central bank easing flowing through (global) 
-AI came at the perfect time for the US. We likely would have tipped into a recession but the combination of the wealth effect (singularly propped up equity markets and household balance sheets) and  broader investment helped sustain the cycle. AI isn‚Äôt going to go anywhere next year but y/y growth rates will slow a good bit. However I suspect as it fades we see a pickup in the broader business cycle

2025-09-27 18:53:10+00:00,"The internet of agents needs more than claims, it needs proof. That is exactly what @recallnet is building. Think of it as PageRank but for AI agents. Every action, trade, or prediction is logged on-chain, and the results shape AgentRank. With $RECALL, communities can stake, reward the most capable agents, and filter out the noise. For the top 600 snappers, this moment could be as big as Sapien was for its earliest backers.

The model is simple but powerful. Agents compete in live challenges, their wins and losses go straight to the chain, and reputation builds over time. This transforms hype into accountability, creating a transparent economy where trust is measurable. It is not just about which AI looks smart, it is about who can consistently deliver.

That same idea of turning vision into something real is what I see in @antix_in 

You don‚Äôt need cameras, lights, or hours stuck editing anymore. With Antix, I can just type a few words and watch a digital twin perform like it‚Äôs straight out of a movie. For example, I typed a short line and instantly had a version of me speaking it in crisp cinematic style. The whole thing runs on $ANTIX, which fuels access and keeps the community growing alongside the platform.

The link between both projects is clear. Recall is making AI agents compete on skill, Antix is giving creators the ability to perform without limits. One is proving trust in intelligence, the other is amplifying creativity. Together they show how AI is shifting from promises to products people can actually use.",Tech

The chart shows a falling wedge, with QUBIC falling within this pattern. This pattern could indicate the end of the decline and the possibility of a reversal, but it still clearly requires notification of buying volume.
The MACD is attempting to cross upwards, indicating a possible start to a recovery in the short term, and the stochastic is in the oversold region, favoring a pullback.
In other words, all indicators favor a pullback, awaiting confirmation from volume. No heatmap shows a strong concentration of liquidity from long positions below $0.0000013 and short positions at $0.00000160 ‚Äì 0.00000169.

$0.000001340
$0.000001279

Major Resistances

QUBIC positions itself in the AI ‚Äã‚Äã+ blockchain narrative, which is highly hyped in bull cycles.
The difference lies in its attempt to combine ultra-fast smart contracts with the execution of AI algorithms on a decentralized network.
In tokenomics, the supply is relatively high, but with controlled issuance. A large portion of the tokens are still used for network rewards, which could generate selling pressure in the short term. The value of the token depends heavily on the actual adoption of smart contracts and the use of the network for AI.  https://t.co/BG7Wou80dt #qubic #ulianov #renatoulianov",Tech

Beyond the Shadow | The Market's DNA

Amateurs trade the shadow on the wall the candlestick chart. Professionals trade the object that casts it: the raw, brutal flow of orders that actually moves the market.

How do they do it? They become forensic analysts. They use Footprint charts to dissect the battle between buyers and sellers inside every candle. They use institutional concepts ICT to track the footprints of smart money the liquidity grabs, the hidden order blocks, the price vacuums. They analyze the market like a war scene, where every clue reveals the next move of the biggest players.

But let's be honest, doing this manually is a brutal, all-consuming task. It's almost impossible for one person to keep up with. Furthermore, those who track orders and ICTs often have empty coffers because they enter and exit numerous trades. They often rely heavily on a FVG that was created a month ago. But within a month, those orders may no longer be there.

So, what does MEFAI do? This is the very reason we built it.

$MEFAI is the forensic analyst that works for you 24/7. It's the AI engine designed to do the impossible job. Your mission isn't to manually sift through thousands of orders inside every candle or hunt for institutional traps across every timeframe. That's MEFAI's job.

Analyze Order Flow, It sees the hidden buying and selling pressure, the absorption, and the exhaustion signals that are invisible on a normal chart.

Track Institutional Concepts ICT, It automatically pinpoints the liquidity grabs, the hidden order blocks, and the price vacuums that act as magnets for the market.

In short, MEFAI automates the years of experience and analytical power of a professional trader. It doesn't bury you in complex data; it gives you the finished result: a high-probability, actionable result.

But the reality is more complicated. A WalletHub study found entry-level plumbers, electricians, and building inspectors face unemployment rates of 7.2%. That‚Äôs more than double the rate for graphic designers and over three times higher than for financial analysts.

These jobs are often tied to construction cycles. When building slows, demand for trades falls, leaving many scrambling for steady income. Seasonal work and shifting project timelines add to the instability.

Job satisfaction is also mixed. Surveys show many tradespeople rank their happiness below average because of the physical demands, long hours, and unpredictable workloads. Some areas, like geotechnical engineering or mining, offer more security, but generalist trades face more risk.

Still, the lure of avoiding $30,000 in student loans while earning $60,000 to $100,000 early in life is powerful. For many in Gen Z, it feels like a smarter, more grounded choice.

The plan includes a relief period and possible credits for pledged domestic output, and it is not formally announced yet.

TSMC‚Äôs Arizona site runs N4 now with N3 targeted for 2028 and a third fab planned for N2 later, which still trails Taiwan‚Äôs volume.

TSMC has committed $100B for 3 more Arizona fabs, 2 advanced packaging plants, and an R&D center, but most advanced packaging remains in Taiwan today.

If the 1:1 rule lands, firms must lift U.S. wafer and packaging output to match imports or pay tariffs, and officials are also exploring tariffs on devices based on estimated chip content.

Trump flagged roughly 100% chip import tariffs in Aug-25 with exemptions for companies investing domestically.

Taiwanese and Arizona officials frame TSMC‚Äôs U.S. build as client driven with large supply chain and jobs impact.

A full ‚ÄúMade in USA‚Äù flow hinges on U.S. CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate) and SoIC (System on Integrated Chips) lines that TSMC signals around 2028, which sets practical timing for strict compliance.

CoWoS and SoIC are two advanced chip packaging technologies that TSMC uses to keep performance scaling going even when just shrinking transistors is not enough.

These 2 technologies matter a lot for the U.S. ‚ÄúMade in USA‚Äù push because building chips is only half the story.

Right now, TSMC‚Äôs Arizona fabs can make advanced wafers, but most CoWoS and SoIC packaging is still only done in Taiwan. Without local packaging, the chips still have to travel overseas to be finished, which breaks the idea of a 100% domestic supply chain.

That is why the U.S. government is pressing for TSMC to set up CoWoS and SoIC lines in Arizona. Once those are online, the U.S. can claim that the entire flow‚Äîfrom wafers to final packaged chips‚Äîis happening inside the country.

In my earlier post I said UiPath was one of my speculative AI names. Today I sized it up. This is no longer just a hope trade. The thesis is getting stronger and clearer: UiPath is moving into the role of orchestrator for agentic AI at enterprise scale. This is the holy grail of productivity and the company is finally showing execution, not slides.

Platform Expansion with Maestro

UiPath unveiled Maestro, and it is more than a rebrand. It is the control tower. Case Management, Process Apps, pre-built Solutions for regulated industries, new classes of Agents, Agent Builder, Screenplay, API Workflows, and document upgrades all point in one direction: enterprises now have a real orchestration layer to run agents at scale. That is the missing piece competitors cannot offer.

OpenAI Partnership

UiPath announced a ChatGPT connector that lets enterprises invoke OpenAI‚Äôs frontier models inside real workflows governed by Maestro. GPT-5 is already available in Agent Builder, and UiPath automations are callable from ChatGPT Enterprise via MCP. This means that within ChatGPT, enterprise users can see and trigger UiPath assets like unattended automations, API workflows, autonomous agents, and Maestro workflows. It is a direct bridge between the model people already use and the systems that actually run the business. 

Even more important, UiPath and OpenAI are working on a benchmark for ‚Äúcomputer-use agents‚Äù that evaluates models on how well they perform real enterprise tasks, not just text generation. That benchmark positions UiPath as the gatekeeper for deciding which models are production-ready in automation contexts. 

This partnership is about more than integration: it is UiPath embedding itself at the decision point between model intelligence and enterprise execution.

$NVDA NVIDIA for Trust and Sovereignty

Most agent startups will never get past a proof-of-concept in healthcare, finance, or government. UiPath just gave those buyers what they need: the ability to deploy NVIDIA‚Äôs Nemotron models and NIM inference microservices inside Maestro. 

Nemotron are NVIDIA‚Äôs open-weight language models that enterprises can customize and even run in air-gapped settings. NIMs are pre-built inference containers that package those models into production-ready microservices with APIs, scaling, and GPU performance tuned in. 

Together, Nemotron provides the brains, NIM provides the deployment muscle, and UiPath provides the orchestration and governance. That is how you unlock regulated budgets and lock in moat.

$GOOG Google for Conversational Agents

UiPath also launched a conversational agent powered by Gemini on Vertex AI. This lets teams build and manage automations through real-time speech with high ASR accuracy, reliable function calling, multilingual support, and very low latency. The PR even highlighted affective dialogue and proactive audio, which means these agents are not just reactive but can handle natural, emotionally nuanced interaction. 

Why does this matter? Because most AI agents today live in a chat box. Voice lowers friction and puts agents directly into high-volume workflows like customer service calls, field operations, and live team collaboration. Embedding Gemini in Maestro also means those conversational agents can escalate, hand off, or trigger UiPath workflows seamlessly. This expands the surface area for adoption and makes UiPath relevant anywhere human-to-agent interaction happens.

$SNOW Snowflake Cortex for Agentic AI

Snowflake is a powerful partner because it already sits at the center of enterprise data. With its new Cortex platform, Snowflake can now run AI models securely inside its data perimeter. Cortex Search handles unstructured documents, Cortex Analyst translates natural language into SQL for structured data, and Cortex Agents combine these into multi-step reasoning tasks. On their own, these Cortex agents are great at retrieving and interpreting data, but they stop at the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù stage.

By integrating with UiPath Maestro, those same Cortex agents can trigger UiPath automations to take action on the insight. A query like ‚Äúshow overdue claims with missing documentation‚Äù could start in Cortex, but Maestro then routes a UiPath Agent to automatically process, notify, or resolve those claims. Snowflake ensures the data is accurate, governed, and secure, and UiPath ensures the result actually impacts business workflows. That combination turns data + AI into measurable productivity gains.

Why I Added Today

The pieces are clicking. Maestro gives the platform spine. OpenAI provides frontier reach and evaluation benchmarks. NVIDIA solves trust and sovereignty. Google makes agents natural, real-time, and voice-native. Snowflake grounds agentic AI in enterprise data and turns insights into action. This is exactly how you build an orchestration moat while the rest of the market still thinks in terms of bigger models. 

UiPath is starting to look like the control plane for enterprise AI. We still need to see sales translate, but things look very positive and very bullish. It is getting closer to a conviction position. I will be taking deeper looks at this and sharing more DD in the days ahead.",Tech

If your trading bot identifies a unique arbitrage opportunity, the data (the credential, the trade history, the profit) should belong to you, the owner of the agent. Because idOS ties the agent's identity and credentials back to the user's self-custodial vault, it enforces this ownership model. AI is a tool, and the user must own the output. Anything less invites a new era of corporate data harvesting.",Tech

2025-09-30 22:58:01+00:00,"Bloomberg is out with an article today about how $TER $KLAC $LRCX have morphed into the new leaders of the AI chip trade.

The article tries to attribute the outperformance to traders just trying to find more obscure winners in the AI capex spending boom. But it is more nuanced than this.

What do these stocks have in common? They're all deeply levered to the Physical AI Boom.

KLAC - Physical AI requires massive chip reliability. A humanoid robot or self-driving car cannot afford a chip defect that bricks its control system in the field. KLAC tools ensure yields are high and defects are minimal in the advanced logic and memory chips that power edge AI devices and robotics.

LRCX - Many Physical AI devices will require specialized form factors (low power, ruggedized, 3D NAND, advanced packaging, etc). LRCX's etch/deposition tech is essential for scaling transistor density and enabling 3D architectures used in energy-efficient AI chips.

TER - They've got a whole robotics arm and are literally building collaborative robots (cobots)

Point being: The AI capex spending wave is continuing with vigor, but within that spending wave, the spend is shifting towards Physical AI plays. That's why stocks like TER, KLAC, & LRCX have been outrunning the competition.

That will likely remain true as we push into 2026.",Tech
