After decades of dependency, Russian gas exports through Ukraine have been halted, marking a significant shift in European energy dynamics. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on the United States to step up and supply more gas to Europe, filling the void left by Russia.

This decision comes amid escalating tensions, further severing Europe’s reliance on Russian energy. The U.S. now faces pressure to support its allies with increased gas exports as Europe scrambles to secure alternative sources.

2025-01-02 16:18:06+00:00,"Tesla missed its delivery numbers. How important is this?

For the first time since its inception, Tesla delivered less vehicles than the year before. And while it is certainly notable, it is also important to consider that Tesla doesn't trade like a car company and certainly isn't valued as one. 

My take: The miss by about 10k from the whisper number and 20k to achieve Y/Y growth may lead to a short downward pressure after Tesla's remarkable run in Q4, but it doesn't change the thesis of the company and what its investors are in it for. 

1. Autonomy and FSD
2. AI, Robotics and Humanoid Robotics 
3. Energy Capture and innovation 

Trading at around 5x higher (forward PE) than its Mag 7 cohort and 8-12x higher than its automotive peers. Tesla is a car company that isn't a car company. And this will likely lead to bigger swings with exponentially more upside. 

If you want safer exposure to AI or Tech then I see the likes of Google, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Apple as a safer play. But I don't think Tesla investors are in it for safe. They are in it for the big wins. Always have been. So, today's number means a little, but not much. 

The real question is whether Elon can achieve the vision of autonomy, and humanoid robots? Its investors clearly believe it can. And I tend to not bet against Musk. Maybe his timelines, but not the ultimate outcome.

- First of all, my bias from the open was bullish as $NVDA was absolutely rocketing right at open. $TSLA also saw some nice strength, as some other large caps did too. 

- My second, and main reasoning for entering the trade was the beautiful bounce from the premarket low ($513.54). As you can see on the chart below, right before my entry, there was a huge red candle which test below this level and bounced right back up. 

- After that red candle formed, I waited for the retest and bounce to confirm my upside bias, and when we retested (see the candle on my entry in the chart below), I entered the play.

- My main target was the $516.60 level, as this was a major level we kept rejecting since yesterday (also see the circles on my chart below).

Better understanding of my last post.

Diplomatic Relations: This call signifies ongoing diplomatic efforts between the US and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. 

Economic Interests: The discussion about resuming oil exports from the Kurdistan Region touches on economic interests. Oil exports are a major source of revenue for the region and Iraq as a whole. The US likely has an interest in stabilizing and supporting Iraq's economy, especially in the context of global oil markets.

Regional Stability: For Iraq, this engagement could mean support in resolving internal issues, particularly those related to oil exports which have been a point of contention between the central government in Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Resolving these issues could lead to more stability within Iraq.

US Foreign Policy: For the US, this engagement fits into broader foreign policy objectives in the Middle East, which include supporting allies, promoting stability, and ensuring the flow of oil, which affects global markets and US energy security.
Political Implications: The conversation about ""mitigating the Show"" might refer to addressing political or public relations strategies, possibly in the context of international perceptions or internal political dynamics within Iraq.

Future Collaborations: Such diplomatic calls often pave the way for future collaborations, whether in security, economic development, or political support against common adversaries or for mutual benefits.

This call is about the importance of dialogue in addressing mutual concerns, particularly in the economic and political spheres, aiming for outcomes that benefit both countries.

Not long ago, America led the world in sea freight. At the end of World War II, the US commercial marine fleet accounted for about half of the world’s cargo-shipping capacity. An American entrepreneur in the 1950s pioneered the shipping container, which revolutionized international commerce. 

US Navy today expends vast resources from the Red Sea to the South China Sea defending the freedom of navigation, but few ships being protected fly the American flag.

US commercial ships today account for less than 1% of the world fleet. US ports are racked by strikes and battles over the type of automation that has supercharged expansion of container terminals across the globe. The Navy struggles to find commercial vessels to support its far-flung operations.

China, meanwhile, dominates both shipping and shipbuilding. Beijing heavily subsidizes its maritime sector, in turn boosting the efficiency of its breakneck naval shipbuilding campaign.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a top oil and gas industry trade group are suing Vermont over its new law requiring that fossil fuel companies pay a share of the damage caused over several decades by climate change.

The federal lawsuit filed Monday asks a state court to prevent Vermont from enforcing the law, which was passed last year. Vermont became the first state in the country to enact the law after it suffered catastrophic summer flooding and damage from other extreme weather. The state is working to estimate the cost of climate change dating back to Jan. 1, 1995.

The lawsuit argues the U.S. Constitution precludes the act and that the state law is preempted by the federal Clean Air Act. It also argues that the law violates domestic and foreign commerce clauses by discriminating “against the important interest of other states by targeting large energy companies located outside of Vermont.”

The Chamber and the other plaintiff in the lawsuit, the American Petroleum Institute, argue that the federal government is already addressing climate change. And because greenhouse gases come from billions of individual sources, they argue it is impossible to measure “accurately and fairly” the impact of emissions from a particular entity in a particular location over decades.

“Vermont wants to impose massive retroactive penalties going back 30 years for lawful, out-of-state conduct that was regulated by Congress under the Clean Air Act,"" said Tara Morrissey, senior vice president and deputy chief counsel of the Chamber’s litigation center. “That is unlawful and violates the structure of the U.S. Constitution — one state can’t try to regulate a global issue best left to the federal government. Vermont’s penalties will ultimately raise costs for consumers in Vermont and across the country.”

A spokesman for the state's Agency of Natural Resources said it had not been formally served with this lawsuit.

Anthony Iarrapino, a Vermont-based lobbyist with the Conservation Law Foundation, said the lawsuit was the fossil fuel industry's way of “trying to avoid accountability for the damage their products have caused in Vermont and beyond.”

“More states are following Vermont’s lead holding Big Oil accountable for the disaster recovery and cleanup costs from severe storms fueled by climate change, ensuring that families and businesses no longer have to foot the entire bill time and time again,"" Iarrapino added.

The following graphic from the Frauenhofer Institute illustrates that Germany has achieved an enormous success story in the field of renewable energy transformation by 2024.

Left: Net electricity imports (imports are carried out when electricity from abroad is cheaper than that produced domestically. As there are enough balancing power plants, the supply needs do not play a role.

Centre: This is the amount of electricity produced in Germany with renewable energies in 2024

Right: Electricity produced using fossil fuels

This graph only shows public electricity generation, but because solar power is growing very strongly among private individuals, both homeowners and flat dwellers, in 2024, the block of renewable energy is even larger when all generation is considered.

Of course, all of this happened without any electricity generation from nuclear energy, which, incidentally, poses a problem if you want to introduce renewable energies due to its inflexibility.

Their new Kinetix Perps V2 lets you trade WTI and Brent oil, which is super cool because it means everyday people can now play with big markets without needing a fancy broker or paying loads of fees.

📌 What makes KinetixFi different?

It's easy to use, even if you're not a pro. They got in early with this idea of mixing different assets in one place, and they use PythNetwork to make sure the price you see is the price you get, no funny business. 

📌 Why does this matter? 

Well, now you can bet on whether oil prices will go up or down, spread your investment across more than just crypto, and maybe even protect yourself from wild swings in the crypto market. 

Before, if you wanted to trade oil, you'd need to go through all these middlemen, but KinetixFi cuts all that out. It's like opening up these big markets to everyone, anywhere, anytime. 

This isn't just about making DeFi bigger; it's about changing how we think about finance. By mixing traditional stuff like oil with blockchain, KinetixFi is showing us that the future of money might be way more open and fair.

 Ukrainian President Zelensky's unilateral decision to stop the transit of any gas through Ukraine is causing significant financial damage to Slovakia and the entire EU. 

And it significantly helps the USA, which can increase gas exports to Europe. 

President Zelenski is sabotaging the financial interests of Slovakia and the EU, despite the fact that the European Commission clearly stated in its official letter that nothing prevents Ukraine from continuing transit.

In the case of Slovakia, it is about damages of 500 million euros in the form of transit fees and 1 billion euros in the form of high gas prices. 
And the entire EU will pay about 70 billion euros for this American adventure. 

To my great surprise, the EU and its bodies are also silent.Tomorrow morning I'm going to Brussels for talks with the energy commissioner and I'll do everything to wake him up from his sweet sleep.

This action, coordinated with the UK, marks an effort to restrict Russia's primary revenue source for funding its war in Ukraine. 

It also addresses the growing challenge of sanctions evasion through shadow fleets and opaque trading networks that have enabled Russia to continue profiting from oil sales despite existing restrictions. 

The measures extend to 183 vessels, primarily oil tankers that are part of Russia's shadow fleet.

Starting on 27 February, the US also prohibits its companies from providing petroleum services to entities in Russia, effectively cutting off access to crucial technical expertise and equipment needed for oil extraction and production.

2025-01-10 20:54:58+00:00,"In 2024, China made a dramatic shift in its energy strategy by significantly reducing its imports of U.S. crude oil, dropping by nearly 46% compared to the previous year. This change reshapes global energy dynamics, as China, which had been the second-largest importer of U.S. crude, now falls to the sixth position in the global rankings. 

With imports down to 81.9 million barrels in 2024 from 115.6 million barrels in 2023, this move signals a broader transformation in China’s approach to energy procurement. This reduction in U.S. crude imports is part of a larger trend in China’s energy landscape, where the country’s overall crude imports have also decreased by 7.2%. Factors like intermittent COVID-19 lockdowns, high domestic inventories, and refinery maintenance have contributed to this downturn. 

However, China’s energy strategy is evolving, with the country increasingly turning to alternative suppliers, particularly from politically isolated nations like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela. These countries offer China discounted crude, allowing refiners to secure lower-cost energy while diversifying supply sources and strengthening energy security. 

China’s imports from Russia, Iran, and Venezuela have increased significantly, making up a larger portion of China’s crude oil supply. This shift is driven by economic benefits, as these nations offer cheaper oil due to Western sanctions. In turn, China’s engagement with these countries enhances its geopolitical leverage and reduces its dependence on U.S. energy exports, providing a strategic advantage in the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. 

This pivot in China’s oil import strategy not only reshapes its energy security but also has far-reaching consequences for the global oil market. It challenges the effectiveness of Western sanctions and exposes vulnerabilities in global energy supply chains, potentially influencing global oil pricing and production strategies. As China strengthens ties with non-Western suppliers, such as Russia and Iran, it positions itself as a central player in the future of global energy markets, with far-reaching implications for U.S.-led frameworks",Energy

The reason for US' trade deficit is Canada selling its oil to the US at a massive discount. ""We are ripping ourselves off because of stupid Liberal energy policies, which limit our exports only to the US!""

So let's stop being stupid and build plants, pipelines & energy infrastructure so we can sell our energy to the rest of the world! That will guarantee Canada's sovereignty & economic independence.

And remind our American friends that they benefit from Canada's affordable energy, while the alternative is oil from dictatorial regimes. ""So why not have a North American energy market that enriches us both!?""

1. Indonesia has the world’s largest reserves of nickel, which is important for making electric-vehicle (EV) batteries.

2. In 2014, the country moved to ban exports of unprocessed ores, and since 2020, when the export ban came into full force, it has come to dominate the nickel market.

3. Dozens of nickel smelters have opened since 2020, led by Chinese smelters. These smelters have proven very innovative in refining once-thought non-commercial Indonesian nickel-ore deposits at scale.

4. Indonesia’s share of the world’s refined nickel production has doubled since 2020 (about 50% of the total).

5. In 2023, Indonesia exported $22bn of processed nickel (9% of the country’s total exports) compared with 2% in 2019.

6. The nickel bonanza lifted Indonesia’s trade surplus to a record high in 2022.

7. The next step is for Indonesia to specialise in parts of the EV supply chain, such as nickel-battery 
precursors.

Further, PADD 2 imports ~3MM Bbl/d from Canada via pipeline with limited/no alternatives. Tariffs also assumed direct pass through to US consumer = inflationary when US 10 year treasuries at 4.6%. 

I met with the CEOs of most CDN oil companies earlier this week and no strong views other than would be temporary and ""this too shall pass."" 

Canadian energy names have lagged their US peers by ~8% since Premier Smith's comments spooked the market. With WTI spot at $78 and 2025 strip at $73 some names are trading at 17%-19% free cashflow yields at $75. A full tariff (and likely VERY temporary) would lower this to still over 10%. While knee jerk reactions are always possible/likely, given the lag in CDN names to the recent rise in WTI fundamentally valuations in several names are already discounting a full tariff. 

We are seeing tariff angst amongst clients and trading desks report heavy US HF selling/shorting. Uncertainty creates opportunity and while no one can be truly certain on the outcome, to us this has become an alpha generating opportunity, with clarity in the coming weeks.",Energy

2025-01-19 19:39:10+00:00,"Should Alberta halt oil exports to the United States? Albertans weigh in

The oil and gas industry is back in the political spotlight, with Alberta Premier Danielle Smith clashing with Trudeau and her fellow premiers over energy policies and economic priorities.

The height of the controversy began earlier this week when the federal government brought the idea of cutting off energy supply to the U.S. and imposing export tariffs on Alberta energy and other products to the United States. Alberta Premier Danielle Smith responded to these threats by saying it would spark a “national unity crisis”. She then flipped off the Trudeau Liberals’ stance, declaring that Alberta would not comply with export tariffs on its oil, gas, and other resources, nor support an outright export ban.

This stems from the statements made by the incoming President of the United States, Donald Trump, who has threatened to impose a 25% export tariff on Canadian goods, citing concerns over border security. He argued that failure to enforce stricter border policies warrants consequences for Canada.

Canada’s premiers and outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met to discuss the challenges and explore possible solutions. However, the Alberta premier strongly opposed the proposals put forward. Smith claimed the policies would strangle Alberta’s economy and accused Ottawa of ignoring provincial rights to control their natural resources.

Instead, she urged Canadians to use this tariff threat as an “opportunity to correct” the misguided direction of this country.” She plans to meet with U.S. lawmakers and officials to make a case against the imposition of tariffs on Canada.

Rebel News took to the streets of downtown Calgary to speak to Albertans about their thoughts on the tariff war between the United States and Canada.

Nigeria was recently admitted as a “partner country” of the BRICS bloc of developing economies, according to Brazil, the group’s chair.

Economically, Nigeria can benefit from increased trade with BRICS nations, especially in oil, gas, agriculture, and manufacturing, which may reduce its dependence on Western economies. Investment from BRICS countries could lead to infrastructure growth and job creation. Being part of BRICS may also help Nigeria reduce reliance on the US dollar for trade, potentially using local currencies or a new BRICS currency.

Politically, Nigeria gains a stronger global voice, potentially influencing international policies and representing African interests. The partnership opens doors to strategic alliances with influential emerging economies. Developmentally, Nigeria could benefit from technological transfers in fields like renewable energy, digital infrastructure, and space technology.

Although Nigeria has been admitted as a partner country, its participation in decision-making will be limited, lacking full membership privileges like voting rights. Nonetheless, Nigeria's inclusion in BRICS signals its rising status in global politics and economics.",Energy

As predicted by Kpler Insight, #gas flows from Slovakia to Austria and Czechia ceased on January 1st. Both countries have increased imports from Germany, primarily benefiting from the lifting of the cross-border gas storage levy, with flows routed through the Brandov and Oberkappel VIPs.

Poland has also halted gas imports via interconnections with Ukraine and Czechia, confirming it had been indirectly sourcing Russian gas through Ukraine until the stoppage. Underground gas storage withdrawals in Slovakia, Austria, and Poland have risen as market players adapt to the evolving supply dynamics.

#LNG will remain central to replacing Russian volumes by 2025, with import capacity in Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Croatia, Greece, and Italy serving as a critical backbone. However, infrastructure bottlenecks along key gas corridors will likely constrain short-term diversification strategies in the CEE region.

Key factors to watch include negotiations to end the Russia-Ukraine war, delays in LNG projects, sanctions on Russian LNG, higher cross-border tariffs, and flow congestion—each shaping Europe's gas supply dynamics.

Alberta Premier Danielle Smith is getting support from an unlikely ally for refusing to sign on to a communique that would have curbed US oil exports — Ontario’s manufacturing sector.

That’s because the Coalition of Concerned Manufacturers and Businesses of Canada (CCMBC) has expressed strong support for Smith in her firm stance against Ottawa’s energy policies and potential US tariffs despite pressure from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and fellow premiers including Ontario’s Doug Ford.

CCMBC president Catherine Swift praised Smith’s strong stance and leadership, stating, “Despite pressure from federal Liberals… and other provincial premiers, Premier Smith is the one truly standing up for Canada’s interests.”

The controversy stems from a communiqué signed by all premiers except Smith, addressing possible retaliatory measures against US tariffs.

Both Smith and Saskatchewan’s Scott Moe argued that the document could have been revised to allow Alberta’s participation without compromising its core intent. Instead, Swift suggested, “Trudeau used this as an opportunity to be divisive, scapegoating Alberta and Smith for not being part of ‘Team Canada’.”

Swift criticized the Trudeau government’s history of targeting Alberta’s energy sector, citing the 1970s National Energy Policy (NEP) and subsequent restrictions on Alberta oil and gas. In that regard, history is repeating itself, she argued.

“Given the federal government’s track record, Smith is right to approach this situation with caution. What we needed was for all premiers to unite against the weak economic policies of the federal Liberal government that have left Canada in a vulnerable position,” said Swift.

Smith’s refusal to align with the federal government has drawn backlash, but the CCMBC contends her stance protects more than just Alberta. “Many manufacturers and businesses across Canada, including those in Ontario, rely heavily on Alberta’s oil and gas sector. By defending this vital Canadian export, Premier Smith is safeguarding not only Alberta’s interests but those of the entire country,” Swift emphasized.

The CCMBC, founded in 2016, advocates for policies that support manufacturing, business retention, and job growth across Canada. Swift underscored the coalition’s shared goal with Smith: “to ensure economic resilience and competitiveness in the face of both domestic and international challenges.”

2025-01-21 19:18:37+00:00,"🔥🔥 A MUST READ 🔥 ➡️I MADE SOME NOTES

The Iraqi Parliament has once again postponed the approval of a crucial budget amendment related to the oil exports of the Kurdistan Region. The amendment, which has sparked heated debate, centers around the payment terms for oil production and transportation in the Kurdish-controlled areas.

In a move that has further intensified the ongoing dispute, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' Al Sudani has proposed a new clause demanding that the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) hand over its natural gas and oil components to Baghdad. This proposal was sent to the Iraqi Parliament, triggering an impasse that has delayed the budget amendment yet again.

Soran Omar, a Kurdish member of the Iraqi Parliament, confirmed. According to Omar, the introduction of this new clause regarding the handover of oil and gas resources has complicated the discussions, leading to the lack of approval for the amendment. He stated, “This new proposal by the Prime Minister has caused problems, and the amendment was not approved as a result.”

The new clause is part of the Iraqi government's efforts to secure control over the oil and gas resources in the Kurdistan Region, which has long been a source of tension between Erbil and Baghdad. While the KRG has maintained its autonomy in managing these resources, the Iraqi government insists on more centralized control as part of its national economic strategy.

The parliamentary session on January 19, 2025, also saw the rejection of a proposal concerning the Kurdistan Region’s oil exports. This proposal aimed to set a provisional payment rate of $16 per barrel for the region's oil production and transportation. The Finance Committee had reviewed the amendment, which would have provided financial relief to the Kurdistan Region, but it was met with strong opposition from Shiite lawmakers. 
➡️( This is not the HCL Law BTW It is the $16 per barrel is payment from the federal government to the KRG for oil, which would then be adjusted against what the KRG owes the Iraqi federal government )

Omar explained that the vote could not take place because the quorum requirement for legal attendance was not met. Shiite legislators argued that $16 per barrel was an excessive amount compared to the $8 per barrel allocated for oil production in southern Iraq. However, KRG leaders had previously insisted on a higher rate of $26 per barrel due to the elevated costs of oil extraction in the region, leading to the compromise figure of $16. 

Escalation of Oil Smuggling Activities

Amidst these political disagreements, there has been a significant increase in oil smuggling activities from the Kurdistan Region to neighboring countries, particularly Iran and Turkey. Following the closure of the official export pipeline in March 2023, a clandestine network has emerged, facilitating the transport of oil via tanker trucks.

Reports indicate that over 1,000 tankers are involved in transporting at least 200,000 barrels of oil daily. This illicit trade is estimated to generate approximately $200 million per month.The oil is sold at significantly reduced prices, ranging between $30 to $40 per barrel, roughly half the global market rate. Despite the substantial revenue generated, the proceeds from these operations are not accounted for in the official coffers of the KRG, raising concerns about transparency and governance. 
➡️( KRG is not sending this to the Iraqi federal government, like all the other Regional Governments in Iraq do)

The smuggling operations have also attracted international attention due to potential violations of sanctions, particularly those imposed by the United States on Iran. The unregulated nature of these transactions poses significant risks, including environmental hazards and the undermining of official economic channels.

Implications for Regional Stability

The deadlock on the budget amendment, coupled with the surge in oil smuggling, has exacerbated the financial crisis in the Kurdistan Region. With official oil revenues suspended and no legal export avenues available, the region faces mounting economic challenges.

Tensions between the Iraqi federal government and the KRG continue to escalate, with implications for both regional stability and the international oil companies operating within the Kurdistan Region.The KRG is under increasing pressure, with lawmakers warning that the unresolved budget issue could lead to further economic difficulties and deepen the rift between Erbil and Baghdad.

Soran Omer have also expressed concern that the failure to pass the budget amendment could lead to the continuation of illicit oil sales, a practice that could undermine the region's economic recovery while depriving its citizens of much-needed revenue. The ongoing standoff between the two sides shows no signs of resolution, leaving the Kurdistan Region in a vulnerable position with little prospect for a swift solution.",Energy

Turkish EU ambassador Faruk Kaymakcı highlighted Turkey’s role, stating, “Türkiye is one of the three or four main energy arteries—whether to use it or not is up to the EU.”

Talks were stalled in 2019 over Mediterranean gas disputes involving Turkey, Cyprus, and Greece. Kaymakcı called the situation a “lose-lose” and noted Cyprus remains the main obstacle to resuming dialogue.

With TurkStream now the sole route for Russian gas to Europe, Türkiye’s importance has grown. Energy analyst Kadri Tastan remarked, “TurkStream is becoming far more important… strengthening Turkey’s position.”

2025-01-30 21:22:20+00:00,"What would happen if Trump imposed tariffs on Canadian crude oil?

Tariffs would make Canadian crude oil too expensive to supply to US refiners, which would have to replace Canadian crude oil with heavy crude oil imported from Latin America or the Middle East.

~90% of Canadian crude oil exported to the US is transported via pipeline systems, and the majority is WCS grade, which is heavy sour crude oil. 

TMX accounts for only 5% of the flow. ~200 kb/d of TMX volume will be re-routed to head from Vancouver to North Asia, and this change in flow is bullish for freight rates.

Tariffs could reduce Canadian crude oil production. If demand for WCS from the PADD 2 refineries decreases, Canada will need alternative sales outlets because the Vancouver alternative route has limited capacity. Therefore, it will have to export through USGC ports.

However, it is unlikely that all of these large volumes will be accepted by USGC ports. The fact that US light oil production has reached its limit is also related to the limited export capacity, and more crude oil will be converted to exports as the LyondellBasell refinery begins to shut down.

Therefore, it is not possible to export all of the volumes over 3mb/d that are subject to tariffs through USGC ports. 

Combining the existing ~4mb/d of WTI exports and ~3.5mb/d of Canadian crude oil exports amounts to ~7.5mb/d, which is well in excess of the USGC export capacity.

In conclusion, there will be a shortage of at least 1.5mb/d of Canadian crude oil export routes. 

As a result, either Canada must reduce production or the marginal cost of importing US crude oil must rise sharply. American taxpayers will be forced to pay for the massive increase in fuel prices.

Therefore, Trump's imposition of tariffs on Canadian crude oil is not easy. If he really does it, he's crazy.

Setup -

2. Identify major and minor key levels - I used 350 as it is psych level and also minor higher-low
3. Do not rush into entries at open

Entries
3.  I used Bookmap to identify the liquidity zone. 350 was lining up with my level and liquidity (Refer to bookmap chart)
4. How the stock reacts near the level is essential. 
Two things that I look for
      a. Low volume into or near the level -
      b. Selling high volume and recapture
5. I tend to predict low of the day and keep my entries close to it

Stop
6. Low of the day if buying after the recapture 
or
7. Below the band if aggressive entry - I used 349

8. Trim > 5R (if possible), the region for trim is prior level if any for example 360 to 363 was previous zone,

I think there is a clear problem with Iranian crude flows. I visited the Ningbo-Zhoushan port yesterday and confirmed that the rumors that Iranian crude is looking for a port for discharge in southern China are true cuz it cannot be discharged directly in Shandong Province, where the final buyers are located. 

Port officials confirmed that Iranian crude oil traders are actually looking for crude oil tanks in Zhoushan.

I don't think there will be a dramatic drop in Iranian crude oil exports like in Trump's first term, but it's clear that there is a problem there.

I'm going to visit Shandong Province today. I want to know what's going on.

“The ratified amendment will come into legal force once published in the Iraqi Official Gazette,” Rahim explained, adding that this final step is pending.
Earlier this month, the Iraqi Parliament passed the first amendment to the Federal Budget Law for 2023-2025, despite a boycott by around 50 lawmakers representing central and southern provinces, and legal disputes over the session’s legitimacy.

The agreements, signed in Algiers on February 11, 2025, represent a significant step toward actualizing a project that has been in discussions for decades.”

Yes, the gas pipeline which will connect the Nigerian gas to European markets is a great playbook.  But as that happens, I want to challenge Nigerian leaders to also implement a gas pipeline that will take Nigerian gas to Nigerian markets!

Many years ago, I was a FUTO intern in NNPC: go to Owaza NNPC flow station to learn from engineers, and seasonally go to Aba to read the meters for billing. In other words, markets like Aba had gas supplies pipelined from the flow station, supporting Aba ceramics, glass and other industries. Today, most of those infrastructures have disappeared.

That brings to my request: can the federal government design and implement a gas pipeline that connects Nigerian markets instead of rushing to export gas to Europe for their companies? We have local companies in Nigeria which need gas and we are not doing much to make gas available to them. My model is a gas pipeline network that connects at least two  cities per state.

I am not saying that Nigeria should not sell to Europe, I am saying that it is unfortunate that this pipeline to Europe is passing Onitsha, and some of our core markets, with no provision for local companies to tap the gas.

2025-02-17 13:22:08+00:00,"🚨NEWS: Tesla braces for delay to China licence as Trump trade tensions mount

Tesla is bracing for a potential delay in obtaining Chinese approval for its autonomous driving technology, as Elon Musk’s electric-vehicle company risks getting dragged into the escalating US-China trade war. 

The company has been told there is no definitive timetable for regulators to approve a licence for it to begin widespread training of its “full self-driving” (FSD) technology, despite an earlier indication that it would get the green light in the second quarter of 2025, people with knowledge of the matter told the Financial Times. 

The licence would be an important step towards $TSLA being able to offer semi-autonomous functionality in its vehicles in China, a development that would boost subscription revenues and help shore up its shrinking sales in the world’s largest automotive market.

The system can accelerate, steer, brake and change lanes but still requires drivers to be alert with their hands on the wheel. 

Tesla had announced in September that it planned to roll out FSD technology in China and Europe in the first quarter of 2025, subject to regulatory approval.

That ambition had already slipped and is now in greater doubt as US President Donald Trump engages in a trade war with China. Beijing imposed retaliatory tariffs on a range of American goods this month after the US put an additional 10% levy on all Chinese products. 

Chinese authorities are contemplating using the approval of Tesla’s autonomous-driving licence as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations with Trump, said two of the people with knowledge of the delay, adding that this was the main reason for the hold-up in granting the permit. 

The approval could still come soon, depending on how trade negotiations developed, one of the people added. But another said that some people at the company believed a speedy consent was unlikely unless there was “a major breakthrough or concession” in trade talks.

In June, Shanghai allowed FSD testing by 10 Tesla vehicles as a precursor to a wider rollout across China, while Tesla also struck a deal last year to use systems from tech group Baidu, which offers navigation and mapping. 

However, Musk said last month that Tesla was “in a bit of a bind” as it tried to deploy FSD in China, stuck between Beijing and Washington’s strict data security rules. 

FSD is based on a machine learning system that is fed billions of hours of video to train an algorithm to make driving decisions in real time. 

“They won’t currently allow us to transfer training video outside of China. And then the US government won’t let us do training in China,” said Musk on Tesla’s latest earnings call. “It’s a bit of a quandary.”",Energy

Don’t let Trudeau sell out Canada’s future — help us fight back!

What would an America First strategy for Canada-U.S. trade look like?

And is there room for a Trump-style mega-deal — even bigger than Greenland?

@EzraLevant is the best-selling author of Ethical Oil: The Case for Canada’s Oil Sands, which made the liberal case that the oil sands are the fair trade coffee of the industry.

In Deal of the Century, Levant looks at Canada-U.S. trade through an America First lens and comes to the compelling conclusion that, far from putting tariffs on Canadian oil, Trump should ink a 50-year, $13 trillion deal to buy all 170 billion barrels of it, shutting out China and giving Canada the means to pay for a rebuilt military.

And as for yanking Trudeau’s chain, Levant has a provocative suggestion for how Trump can do that without hurting America’s economic interests.

Tokenization turns real world assets (RWAs) – like oil, real estate, or solar energy farms – into digital tokens on the blockchain, making them easier to buy, sell, and trade.

But how does the process actually work, and can it be trusted?

1. Verify the Asset
The asset is checked for ownership, value, and legal status before being tokenized. Plume Arc simplifies this process by providing a unified platform with 50+ modular features for registering RWAs onchain.

2. Ensure Compliance
RWAs must follow financial laws. Plume Arc integrates compliance tools like KYC/KYB, custody, and on/off-ramps, ensuring assets meet regulations from day one.

3. Create Digital Tokens
The asset is converted into crypto tokens, which can be fractionalized so more people can buy them.

4. Trade and Manage Tokens
Tokens can be bought, sold, or transferred instantly. Plume Nexus Data Highway ensures accurate, real-time data flow, keeping asset information secure and up to date.

5. Hold or Redeem the Asset
Users can trade tokens, hold them, or redeem them for the real asset. Code in smart contracts automates transactions safely without needing any middle parties.

Plume makes it easier for businesses to bring RWAs onchain

Tokenization makes RWAs more accessible, but challenges like regulations, technical complexity, and liquidity have slowed adoption. Plume’s full-stack solution solves this with:

🪙 Plume Arc – A complete tokenization platform with 50+ built-in compliance and asset management tools
🪙 Plume Nexus Data Highway – A secure data infrastructure for smooth tokenization and trading

2025-02-21 19:56:03+00:00,"🔥🇺🇸🇮🇶The United States of America threatened, today, Friday, February 21, 2025, the federal government in Iraq with sanctions if the Kurdistan Region's oil exports are not resumed quickly.

Reuters quoted sources as saying: ""The administration of President Donald Trump asked Iraq to resume (Kurdish) oil exports quickly or face sanctions alongside Iran.""

The sources added, according to Reuters, that ""Washington believes that Kurdish oil sales may help reduce crude prices and compensate for the decline in Iranian supplies.""

Oil Minister Hayan Abdul Ghani revealed on Tuesday that Iraq had sent a delegation from the ministry to the Kurdistan Region to agree on a mechanism for delivering the region’s oil and exporting it through the Turkish port of Ceyhan.

The Minister of Oil explained that he had contacted the Minister of Natural Resources in the region, Kamal Mohammed Saleh, to negotiate with the delegation about the mechanism for receiving and exporting oil through the Turkish port of Ceyhan.

This came a day after Iraq accelerated the expected date for the resumption of oil exports from Kurdistan, as the federal oil minister said last Monday that oil exports from the Kurdistan region could resume within just a week.

It is noteworthy that the President of the Region, Nechirvan Barzani, announced a few days ago that the resumption of shipments will likely take place next March.

Iraq exports between 400,000 and 500,000 barrels per day from fields in the north of the country, including the Kurdistan region, via the now-defunct Iraq-Turkey pipeline.

Oil Minister Hayan Abdul Ghani said earlier this month that at least 300,000 barrels per day of crude were planned to be moved once operations resumed.

In Iraqi Kurdistan, oil production ranges between about 280,000 and 300,000 barrels per day, and the regional government estimates its needs for domestic consumption - including power generation - at about 110,000 to 120,000 barrels per day.",Energy

ERBIL (Kurdistan24) – In a significant breakthrough, Erbil and Baghdad have reached an agreement to resume the Kurdistan Region’s oil exports, marking a step toward resolving a longstanding economic and political dispute.
As part of the agreement, a joint technical committee has been formed to inspect and assess Kurdistan’s oil export pipelines.
The Kurdistan Regional Government’s (KRG) negotiating delegation announced the agreement on Sunday, emphasizing that it was reached following extensive communications and coordination between the Iraqi Federal Oil Ministry and the Kurdistan Region’s Ministry of Natural Resources (MoNR).
According to the statement, oil exports will resume in accordance with available quantities, ensuring a gradual return to international markets.
To facilitate this process, a joint technical team was established on Sunday to conduct inspections on Kurdistan’s oil export pipelines. This step is aimed at ensuring the smooth and efficient flow of oil exports, which have been suspended for nearly two years.
“In this regard, we reaffirm our commitment to implementing the provisions of the federal general budget law,” the KRG delegation stated, signaling a commitment to the legal and regulatory framework governing oil revenues and resource management in Iraq.
The agreement follows an announcement by the Iraqi Oil Ministry on Saturday stating that all necessary procedures for resuming Kurdistan’s oil exports via Turkey’s Ceyhan port have been completed.
Read More: Iraq and Kurdistan Region Finalize Mechanism to Resume Oil Exports
This development paves the way for Kurdistan’s crude oil to re-enter international markets, stabilizing the region’s energy sector and restoring a crucial revenue stream for both Erbil and Baghdad.
The halt in Kurdistan’s oil exports, which lasted nearly two years, has had profound economic ramifications, resulting in an estimated $26 billion in losses for both Iraq and the Kurdistan Region.
The prolonged suspension also disrupted global energy markets, exacerbating supply chain challenges and economic uncertainty.
Reports by Reuters, citing eight different sources, previously suggested that the Trump administration had urged Iraq to expedite the resumption of Kurdistan’s oil exports, highlighting the geopolitical and economic significance of Kurdish crude in the broader energy landscape.
As Erbil and Baghdad move forward with the technical implementation of this agreement, attention will be focused on ensuring transparency and efficiency in oil export operations.
The resumption of exports is expected to provide much-needed financial relief to the Kurdistan Region while also strengthening the broader economic ties between the federal and regional governments.

2025-02-24 12:32:59+00:00,"“Rising US Oil Imports: Sectoral Winners and Losers in India’s Economy”

India’s crude oil imports from the United States surged to 218,400 barrels per day (bpd) in January 2025, a sharp increase from 70,600 bpd in December 2024. This development aligns with the observation from our earlier post*—India is strategically adjusting its import sources in response to trade deficit concerns raised by the new US administration.

Over the course of 2025, India’s crude oil and natural gas imports from the US is expected to reach $25 billion, up from $15 billion in 2024, as per recent government messaging. However, this shift is expected to come at the expense of Russian imports, as the US deploys energy-related sanctions to curb Moscow’s revenue streams and pressure them to end the war in Ukraine. For India, this transition carries substantial economic implications, particularly as Russian crude was available at a 15-20% discount to global market prices, significantly reducing our fuel bill over the past two years.

While increased crude procurement costs are likely to push up India’s fuel expenses, the direct impact on Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation needs to be assessed in a broader context. One silver lining is that WPI inflation has been cooling in recent months, declining from 3.43% in June 2024 to 2.31% in January 2025.

A key factor providing relief is the downward trend in food prices—which hold a 15% weight in WPI. The WPI food inflation rate has eased to 5.8% in January 2025, down from 6.9% year-on-year, driven by normalizing supply chains and improved crop yields. This could help cushion the impact of rising crude costs on overall inflation.

Analyzing major market sectors by their crude price sensitivity reveals three distinct segments. These sectors can either be producers or consumers of the WPI components, i.e. the nature of their exposure (to crude prices) differs based on their role in different supply chains.

High impact sectors, where crude or its derivatives serve as direct input material. This includes oil marketing companies, refineries, petrochemicals, and synthetic textiles which face direct margin pressure due to higher crude prices.

Medium impact sectors include industries where crude oil complements the core production process, but isn't a direct input. The cement sector and airlines are examples, where crude oil and its derivatives play an enabling role in the production process or service being offered.

Low impact sectors are those where crude primarily influences transportation costs—both for raw materials and finished goods. This encompasses metals, FMCG, pharmaceuticals, and most agricultural commodities. These sectors face limited direct exposure to crude price variations.

This analysis suggests that while higher US crude import costs will affect different sectors disproportionately, the impact on overall WPI might be moderated by strong agricultural performance expected this year. Hence, this should not have a significant bearing on the RBI’s monetary policy trajectory.

The addition of the Keystone XL pipeline could see Canada's oil exports to the U.S. boosted by 20%, Edmonton Sun columnist Lorne Gunter told The Ezra Levant Show, something that would be “huge” for both countries' economies.

Building the Keystone XL pipeline is something Donald Trump would like to see done “NOW,” something the U.S. president wrote on his Truth Social platform. The statement got the backing from Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, who said added the countries should be exploring economic opportunities like this instead of engaging in a trade war.

On Tuesday night's episode of The Ezra Levant Show, Edmonton Sun columnist Lorne Gunter joined the show to talk about the reversal from the U.S. after it was cancelled in 2020 during the early days of the Biden administration.

Looking at what the completion of this project could mean for Canada's economy, Lorne said “it's huge.”

“I'd love to see it; 830,000 extra barrels a day to the United States,” he added. “It would increase our exports to the U.S. — one pipeline — would increase our exports to the United States by nearly 20%.”",Energy

This visit reaffirms the Federal Government’s commitment to advancing renewable energy, industrialization, and technology-driven innovation as key drivers of economic growth.

As the global energy landscape shifts towards cleaner alternatives, investments in green hydrogen and green methanol production are positioning Nigeria at the forefront of green energy innovation.

The integration of science and technology in this sector will not only drive industrial development but also create jobs, attract foreign investment, and strengthen Nigeria’s standing in the global energy market.

During our visit, we received a comprehensive technical briefing, conducted a thorough site inspection, and engaged in high-level strategic discussions on optimizing innovation for industrial growth.

Our primary objective is to ensure that this project aligns with national priorities, particularly in building a robust research and development ecosystem that drives sustainable energy solutions.

The success of transformative projects like this requires strong collaboration between the public and private sectors, and I am confident that our engagements will further strengthen this partnership.

Much like the Industrial Revolution reshaped economies in the past, we are now on the brink of a Renewable Energy Revolution—and Nigeria must take the lead.

2025-02-28 20:34:35+00:00,"Basis Trade Vaults are coming with @Lombard_Finance and @ether_fi.

The Idea
Bitcoin is digital gold, Ethereum is digital oil. They're fundamental assets yet, they often sit idle missing yield. In 2023/24, basis trading and LSTs surged in popularity; unlocking new layers of yield. Now we take it one step further.

Enter basis trading vaults. Idle LSTs/LRTs are combined with staking rewards and a delta=1 basis trade. Unlike traditional basis strategies that hedge out price movements, these vaults keep full exposure to BTC and ETH; meaning you still benefit from price appreciation while earning yield from funding spreads.

The Strategy
A basis trade exploits the difference between spot and perpetual futures prices. The vault mechanics are straightforward:
➤ Deposit. Provide LBTC or weETH as collateral.
➤ Leverage & Hedge. Borrow stablecoins, buy more LBTC/weETH (Derive secret sauce), and short perps to lock in the basis spread.
➤ Earn. Collect staking rewards, funding rate differentials, and amplified points from atomic execution.

What if the market moves against me?
The strategy stays hedged. Holding 2 LBTC or weETH against a $100k debt stays safe even if BTC/ETH 100x’s or drops 90%. Gains on one leg offset losses on the other; price is a non-issue. The only pricing risk is a depeg.

What if funding flips or borrowing costs spike? 
If perp funding turns negative or stablecoin borrow rates rise, the system automatically reduces leverage to avoid prolonged negative carry.

Are there any liquidity risks?
In cases of low spot or perp liquidity, the vault may take longer to exit positions, potentially resulting in brief periods of negative funding.

The Yield
➤ Perp Funding (est. 10-20%) – Borrow Rate (5-10%) = Basis Yield
➤ Leveraged LBTC & weETH Staking + Points = Additional APR
➤ Compounded, this turns idle BTC & ETH into a more efficient yield engine.

Basis trading has long been a staple in TradFi, generating steady, predictable returns by capturing spreads between spot and futures markets. Now, with yield-bearing collateral like LSTs and LRTs, the strategy is being automated for DeFi.

Institutions are taking note. As the market matures, structured, delta-neutral strategies are moving from niche to necessity. More to follow.",Energy

""The APIKUR spokesperson went on to detail that the ""APIKUR member companies have not received any outreach to establish new agreements that provide surety of payment for past and future exports consistent with our existing contractual legal and commercial terms.”

🔹 A surety in payments refers to a person or entity that guarantees the payment of a debt or obligation if the primary party responsible for the payment fails to fulfill their obligation. The surety provides financial security to the creditor, ensuring that the payment will be made even if the debtor defaults. 🔻 
🔸 A Surety Bond - A guarantee issued by a third party (such as an insurance company or bank) to ensure that a contractual obligation, such as a payment, will be met.
🔸 A Guarantor - An individual or company that agrees to cover the debt if the primary borrower defaults.

🔹 A surety in payments is a legally binding agreement. When a person or entity (the surety) agrees to guarantee the payment obligations of another party (the principal), they are legally obligated to fulfill the payment if the principal defaults. The terms of the surety agreement are typically outlined in a contract, which defines the responsibilities of the principal, the surety, and the creditor (the beneficiary). If the principal fails to meet their obligations, the creditor can legally enforce the surety's commitment to pay.

Pacific Island countries are increasingly looking to seal partnerships to enhance cooperation across key sectors, including trade, tourism, infrastructure, climate resilience and renewable energy, as well as seabed minerals development. In this edition of Leaders Talk, CMG's Zou Yun sat down in Harbin, in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, with Mark Brown, prime minister of the Cook Islands, where he attended the closing ceremony of the Asian Winter Games during his week-long state visit to China from February 10 to 16. For the Cook Islands, a country that formalized diplomatic relations with China 28 years ago, partnership with China is primarily centered on mutual respect and sustainable development. ""My visit is planting the seeds for long-term collaboration,"" Brown said.

2025-03-07 18:45:28+00:00,"End of week thoughts: President Trump’s tariff tango keeps the market guessing on which foot to dance.

OPEC+ trusted its oil balance enough to initiate the unwinding of voluntary cuts, or alternatively, it could be argued that OPEC+ sent an olive branch to President Trump to show it was doing its part, without losing face, in helping to bring the oil price down. Take your pick; it does not matter as the small incremental volume to be reinstated in the coming months is irrelevant in the larger scheme of things, given the gross non-compliance by member countries like the UAE or Iraq. The global oil balance is long in 2025, so the optics of OPEC+’s decision wrong-footing expectations were inevitably going to be treated as price-negative from a sentiment point of view. ICE Brent briefly traded under $69/bbl as a result. That should tell you something. Today’s comments by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Novak about OPEC+ potentially reducing output to address any “imbalance” in the future to shore up sentiment fell on deaf ears.

President Trump’s tariff tango kept the market guessing on which foot to dance. Aggressive US economic and foreign policy offset each other in terms of oil price impact this week. On the one hand, the imposition of tariffs on Canada and Mexico seems to be now complicated by the provisions of the USMCA trade accord, and the timeline is consistently shifting it seems, as is what will fall under tariffs. Add to that President Trump touted the possibility of reciprocal tariffs being introduced as soon as today, and you have bearish cocktail for price. On the other hand, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent provided bullish fodder, and he did not mince his words indicating the US would be prepared to reduce Iranian crude oil exports to a trickle and cripple Iran’s economy under a maximum pressure policy – hard to say if the US is really going ‘all-in’ or is this the usual waiving of the big stick again to advance an alternative agenda. Mr Bessent's comments managed to pull Brent out from the $60 handle doldrums, sending the front-month ICE contract towards $71.50/bbl.

However, the end-of-week price action would not have been complete without President Putin. Headlines emerged today indicating that Russia would be prepared to talk about a temporary truce in the Ukraine War if there was progress towards a final peace settlement. Flat price fell towards $70.25/bbl at the time of writing. For all the gyrations in the flat price this week, prompt Brent time-spreads have not collapsed and are holding at 50 cents, which should provide OPEC with some comfort that the wheels have not yet come off the fundamental cart. With steady spreads, the curve is trying to find a new level amidst the general uncertainty, so expect more parallel shifts in the curve until market sentiment settles, assuming it can settle amidst the Trump whirlwind.

2025-03-07 20:47:29+00:00,"Here's a summary of the key developments in the oil and gas industry over the past week: 

U.S. Policy and Market Impacts

Natural Gas Exports: In Port Sulphur, Louisiana, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright underscored the administration's support for expanding natural gas exports. They criticized previous climate policies and highlighted plans for an $18 billion expansion by Venture Global to export LNG to Europe and Asia. ​https://t.co/Yjo5dNWu7n

Oil Prices and Economic Concerns: President Trump's efforts to lower energy prices, including pressuring OPEC to increase oil production, have led to a drop in oil prices. This decline poses challenges for Texas oil producers, potentially leading to job losses and economic downturns in the region. Additionally, tariffs on steel have increased costs for the oil industry, exacerbating the situation. ​https://t.co/ICP2xpDBYB

Corporate Movements

Hedge Fund Positioning: Elliott Management has taken a €670 million short position in TotalEnergies, amounting to 0.52% of the company's stock. This move follows Elliott's investment in BP, where it owns nearly 5% and is advocating for a greater focus on oil and gas. Despite TotalEnergies' strong performance and moderate stance on energy transition, the sizable short position is notable. ​https://t.co/jbbfydWdSR

Geopolitical Events

Infrastructure Attacks: Russian forces targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, damaging natural gas production facilities owned by Naftogaz. The attacks affected multiple regions, prompting efforts to stabilize power and gas supplies. This escalation underscores the vulnerability of energy infrastructure in conflict zones. ​https://t.co/93LJeoBoMB

Industry Outlook

Net-Zero Emissions Projections: A survey by Bain and Company reveals that nearly half of energy and natural resources executives now predict that net-zero emissions won't be achieved until 2070 or later, up from 32% last year. Rising costs, financial constraints, and a shift towards prioritizing returns over environmental investments contribute to this growing pessimism. ​https://t.co/cC6jQOwtxr

Regulatory Developments

North Sea Drilling Ban: The UK government has confirmed a ban on new drilling licenses in the North Sea as part of its strategy to transition to cleaner energy. An eight-week consultation will address concerns over potential job losses and energy security. The move aligns with the UK's commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, making it the first major G7 oil producer to halt new oil and gas licensing. ​https://t.co/JQ6FMw326u

Premier Smith pointed out that President Trump's proposed 10% tariffs on Canadian energy instead of 25% like other goods signifies the critical nature of Canadian oil for the United States.

The president previously floated the idea of reviving the Keystone XL pipeline project that was cancelled by the Biden administration. However President Trump has also repeatedly threatened to impose a 10% tariff on Canadian oil as well, although he walked back the threat yesterday.

@Dfildebrandt commented on the back-and-forth nature of Trump's messaging surrounding Canadian energy and what his real plans could be.

""I'm not sure there is understanding it,"" he said. ""There's a 'mad dog' theory of Trump, that he's just throwing us off and softening us up, but I'm not seeing any strategy in this,"" he added.

Speaking specifically on Trump's tariff threats on Canadian oil, Fildebrandt was perplexed by Trump's thought process.

""It's not good for American refineries, it's not good for American energy independence...it doesn't square with Keystone XL, I'm just not seeing any strategy here,"" he said.

President Trump announced on Thursday that he would be scaling back some tariffs for Canada until at least April 2.

2025-03-09 17:08:57+00:00,"🔥Iraq tells US: Stopping Iranian gas imports will cause electricity system to collapse🔥

On Sunday, the head of the Finance Committee in the Iraqi Parliament, Atwan Al-Atwani, sent a letter to the US government stating that stopping the import of gas from Iran will cause the collapse of the electricity grid system during the coming summer in Iraq, indicating the need to extend the exemptions granted to Iraq in this regard after they were officially stopped by the administration of US President Donald Trump.

This came during Al-Atwani's meeting with the US Ambassador to Iraq, Daniel Rubinstein, and the accompanying delegation, according to the MP's media office.

The head of the Parliamentary Finance Committee stressed the importance of this visit at this sensitive time, and stressed the need for continuous communication to correct the course of Iraqi-American relations.

The statement added that the meeting focused on discussing the US sanctions file and their impact on the electricity sector, especially in light of talk about the expiration of the deadline for Iraq to be exempted from importing Iranian gas.

The statement also indicated that Al-Atwani conveyed an important message to the US ambassador to his country's government, stating that stopping gas imports would have disastrous consequences for the Iraqi people, especially in the summer, as it would cause the collapse of the national electricity system, due to the lack of any alternatives at the present time.

Al-Atwani said during the meeting that the Iraqi government is serious about achieving energy independence through several promising projects related to investing in associated gas, for the purpose of using it in generating electricity and achieving self-sufficiency, but these projects will enter service in the coming years.

Al-Atwani also called on the US administration to review the policy of pressure exerted by the US Treasury on the financial and banking sector in Iraq by imposing continuous sanctions on local banks.

He pointed out that Iraq has achieved a qualitative shift in the policy of compliance and financial transfers, and despite that, we are surprised by collective sanctions targeting Iraqi banks without prior warning and without any declared justification or even notifying the Central Bank of Iraq about that, and this has created a major problem for us and affected the work and activity of the banking sector.

In turn, the US Ambassador expressed his understanding of what Al-Atwani had raised during the meeting regarding the energy and banking sanctions files, and promised to convey these messages to his country's government in the hope of finding permanent treatments and solutions that would achieve the interests of the two friendly peoples, noting that the import of natural gas is, until now, outside the sanctions system, according to the statement.",Energy

2025-03-09 18:39:36+00:00,"“But we shouldn’t build trade diversification infrastructure like pipelines because of “peak oil” demand.”

This is 100% false. 

Anti-Canadian pipeline groups and their supporters have been saying the same thing since they started protesting Keystone XL in 2010.

Since then, oil demand has gone from 92 million barrels per day to 105 million barrels per day currently.

Then they obstructed Northern Gateway, Energy East, Trans Mountain, and numerous LNG projects.

This was never in the national interest.

But who has benefited from all the division, fear and falsehoods these groups spread? Foreign oil and gas producers who benefit at Canada’s expense.

Of course these groups also never protested billions of dollars of oil imports coming to Canada either.

In the next 5 years, oil demand is forecasted to reach 110 million barrels per day and is expected to remain above 100 million barrels per day for years to come.

In the next 15 years LNG demand is forecasted to grow 60%.

Whatever oil and natural gas demand is, Canada should be a supplier of choice. 

The economic benefits should support Canadian families — not be forfeited to foreign producers.

But how much is available for countries to offset their trade balances? How much investment from other countries is needed in the US? Would investing in shipbuilding in the US count?

He also covers the merger of Whitecap and Verdin to create a major Canadian oil producer and highlights the growing importance of natural gas as America’s top export, particularly under President Trump’s trade rebalancing.

2025-03-11 21:04:28+00:00,"BREAKING: Fox News henchman Peter Doocy brutally confronts Donald Trump to his face for destroying the economy with his disastrous tariffs — while Elon Musk lurks in shame nearby.

What was supposed to be a Tesla sales pitch quickly devolved into a humiliating mess...

""President Trump, you're buying a new car while there are some folks who will see this clip at home and they are struggling with their retirement accounts down at the moment, uncertainty about work ahead..."" said Doocy.

""Well, I think they're gonna do great. I think we're, uh, our country had to do this. We had to go and do this,"" said Trump. ""They've taken away... Other countries have taken away our business. They've taken away our jobs.""

""Uh, I did it, uh, initially very strongly against — as you know China and some others in the first term — and it was a very successful term,"" continued Trump. ""We had no inflation.""

""We had the greatest economy in the history of our country and then we had COVID which we had to straighten out,"" said Trump, conveniently eliding the fact that he botched the pandemic response.

The confrontation came during a PR event at the White House during which Trump touted his decision to buy a Tesla, a pathetic and transparent effort to boost the plummeting stock of his oligarch puppetmaster's flagship company.

Elon Musk himself was present for the proceedings, wearing the trademark sunglasses that many have speculated are meant to hide his alleged ketamine abuse.

At another point during the tacky car salesman routine, Trump was confronted by a different reporter—

""Mr. President you mentioned the ups and downs in the stock market. You said it'll go up, it'll go down but do you and your tariff policies right now bear any responsibility for the turmoil we're seeing this week?"" asked a reporter.

""No, I think that uh... Biden gave us a horrible economy,"" lied Trump. ""He gave us horrible inflation and I think the, uh, market was gonna go very, very bad.""

The truth, of course, is that we are hurtling towards a recession because Trump decided to hit Canada and Mexico with punishing tariffs for no discernible reason beyond exciting his xenophobic base.

""Uh, if anything I have a lot of very smart people, friends of mine, and great businessman, they're now investing because of what I'm doing,"" Trump claimed. ""Because long term what I'm doing is making our country strong again.""

""Financially strong. Militarily strong,"" he continued. ""And strong — and we want to get away — remember this, we have wars — when I left we had no wars. We didn't have Ukraine and Russia. We didn't have October 7th. We didn't have that disaster that took place with the withdrawal from Afghanistan and you look at what's happened there.""

Outside of the lie-riddled and inane remarks Trump spewed, the event itself was an utter disgrace. Using the White House to sell cars for a billionaire crony is a new low for the American presidency.

This is the most corrupt administration in history.

A leak has revealed that Russia is using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for trade with China and India, bypassing international sanctions.

Russian oil companies have reportedly adopted crypto transactions to convert rubles into yuan and rupees, and the practice is expected to continue even if sanctions are lifted.

Meanwhile, Russia’s central bank has quietly moved to allow a ""limited circle of investors"" to buy and sell Bitcoin. The Bank of Russia has sent proposals to the government to regulate crypto investments, marking a major shift in policy.

This comes as Trump’s administration has reportedly halted the sale of seized Bitcoin and is working on making Bitcoin a U.S. strategic reserve asset.

2025-03-16 20:24:07+00:00,"🔥🛢️Kirkuk is prepared to resume oil exports to Ceyhan, Turke pipline, pumping tests on March 16, was successful.

1. Kirkuk's Readiness to Resume Oil Exports
Announcement: Sources within the Iraqi North Oil Company (NOC) confirmed on Sunday, March 16, 2025, that Kirkuk is prepared to resume oil exports to Ceyhan, Turkey, at an initial rate of 100,000 barrels per day (bpd). An ""experimental"" pumping operation is underway to verify the pipeline's readiness.

Key Figures Involved: Amer Khalil Ahmed, the Director General of NOC, participated in meetings with Iraq’s Deputy Prime Minister for Energy and Oil Minister Hayan Abdul Ghani, alongside Turkish Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar. These discussions affirmed NOC’s technical readiness to restart exports.

Timeline: The resumption hinges on an official directive from the Federal Ministry of Oil. Once approved, NOC claims it can begin pumping within hours.

2. Pipeline Repairs After ISIS Damage
Repairs Completed: The Iraqi-Turkish pipeline, previously sabotaged by ISIS, has been fully repaired. The damaged sections between Kirkuk, Salahuddin, Nineveh, and the Iraqi-Turkish border have been fixed, with affected parts replaced.

Testing: NOC conducted successful two-stage pumping tests over a year ago:
Stage 1: From Kirkuk fields to Baiji refineries.
Stage 2: From Baiji through Nineveh to Dohuk, confirming the pipeline’s 100% operational readiness.

3. Current Production and Allocation
Production Capacity: NOC currently produces around 250,000 bpd from Kirkuk fields.
Allocation:
10,000 bpd is exported to Jordan.
100,000 bpd is used for local refining.
Additional amounts supply private refineries in Erbil and Sulaymaniyah (Kurdistan Region) for gasoline and oil derivatives, as determined by the Ministry of Oil.

Export Potential: The initial export target is 100,000 bpd to Ceyhan, with the possibility of increasing this based on production and federal approval.

4. Negotiations and Delays
Dependency on Talks: The resumption of exports depends on ongoing negotiations between the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and Turkish authorities. While NOC is technically ready, political and financial agreements remain unresolved.

Turkish Visit: On March 16, 2025, Turkish Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar arrived in Baghdad to discuss oil, gas, and energy cooperation with Hayan Abdul Ghani, signaling progress but no final resolution yet.

The pipeline has been shut since March 2023, when Turkey halted flows after an arbitration ruling ordered it to pay Iraq $1.5 billion for facilitating unauthorized Kurdish oil exports (2014–2018) without Baghdad’s consent. Turkey refused to pay, instead asking the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) to cover the fine, leading to a prolonged standoff.

5. Technical and Strategic Insights
Experimental Pumping: Energy specialist Yusef Mahmoud emphasized that the current pilot pumping assesses the pipeline’s safety and the readiness of pumping stations, critical after repeated ISIS attacks.

Potential Impact: Resuming exports could stabilize Iraq’s oil shipments (previously 400,000–500,000 bpd from northern fields, including Kurdistan) and ease market pressures. Iraq aims to export at least 300,000 bpd once operations restart, with Kirkuk oil designated for local use and Kurdistan oil potentially flowing through Ceyhan.

6. OPEC Compliance and Future Plans
Minister’s Statements: On February 24, 2025, Hayan Abdul Ghani said that Iraq awaits Turkey’s approval to restart Kurdistan oil exports, potentially within days. He clarified that Kirkuk oil would remain for domestic use, while exports would focus on Kurdistan production.

OPEC Commitment: Abdul Ghani assured that Iraq’s OPEC+ obligations would be maintained, with export volumes controlled by the federal ministry via the State Oil Marketing Company (SOMO).

Difference Between Kirkuk and Kurdistan Oil Flows
The  two distinct oil production and export systems in northern Iraq: Kirkuk (managed by the federal government via NOC) and the Kurdistan Region (managed by the KRG). Here’s how they differ:

1. Ownership and Control
Kirkuk Oil:
Controlled by the Iraqi federal government through the North Oil Company, a state-owned entity under the 
Ministry of Oil.
Fields are located in Kirkuk province, a disputed area between Baghdad and the KRG but currently administered by federal authorities.
Oil is subject to federal policies, including allocation for local refining, exports to Jordan, and potential exports via Ceyhan, all managed by SOMO.

Kurdistan Oil:
Managed by the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) through its Ministry of Natural Resources.
Produced from fields within the Kurdistan Region (e.g., Taq Taq, Tawke), separate from Kirkuk.
Historically exported independently by the KRG via a dedicated pipeline to Ceyhan, bypassing federal control, which led to disputes with Baghdad.

2. Pipeline Infrastructure
Kirkuk Oil:
Uses the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline (Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline), a federal asset repaired by NOC after ISIS damage. This pipeline runs from Kirkuk through Salahuddin, Nineveh, and Dohuk to the Turkish border, then to Ceyhan.
Capacity was historically higher (up to 1.6 million bpd), but current flows are limited by repairs and federal decisions (targeting 100,000 bpd initially).

Kurdistan Oil:
Uses a separate KRG-built pipeline connecting Kurdish fields (e.g., Taq Taq, Khurmala) to the federal Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline at the Turkish border (Fish-Khabur).
Before the 2023 shutdown, it exported 370,000–450,000 bpd, significantly more than Kirkuk’s current contribution.

3. Export Volumes and Purpose
Kirkuk Oil:
Current production is 250,000 bpd, with most allocated domestically (100,000 bpd for refining, 10,000 bpd to Jordan). Only 100,000 bpd is proposed for export initially, with Abdul Ghani stating it’s primarily for local use.
Exports are fully integrated into Iraq’s OPEC+ quotas and federal revenue system.

Kurdistan Oil:
Pre-2023 exports ranged from 400,000–500,000 bpd, including Kurdish production and some federal oil from Kirkuk fields.
The KRG aimed to export independently for regional revenue, but Baghdad insists all exports go through SOMO, creating a legal and financial conflict.
4. Legal and Political Disputes

Kirkuk Oil:
Fully under federal jurisdiction, with no significant legal disputes over its export via Ceyhan once technical and diplomatic hurdles are cleared.

Kurdistan Oil:
Subject to a long-standing dispute with Baghdad, exacerbated by the 2023 arbitration ruling against Turkey for facilitating KRG exports without federal approval. This led to the pipeline closure and ongoing talks to align KRG exports with SOMO.
5. Impact of Resumption

Kirkuk Oil:
Restarting exports at 100,000 bpd would boost federal revenue and demonstrate NOC’s operational capacity, but it’s a smaller-scale operation compared to past northern exports.

Kurdistan Oil:
Resuming 300,000–450,000 bpd would significantly impact KRG’s economy (reliant on oil revenue) and global supply, but it requires resolving payment disputes with oil companies and Turkey’s $1.5 billion fine.

 Kirkuk’s technical readiness to export 100,000 bpd via the repaired Iraqi-Turkish pipeline, pending federal and Turkish approval. Meanwhile, Kurdistan’s larger export potential (300,000+ bpd) remains stalled due to political and financial disputes. Kirkuk oil is federally controlled and prioritized for local use, while Kurdistan oil, managed by the KRG, seeks independent export channels, creating a complex dynamic in Iraq’s northern oil strategy. The experimental pumping on March 16, 2025, is a step toward resuming Kirkuk flows, but broader resumption hinges on Baghdad-Ankara negotiations.",Energy

Sabah Subhi, a member of the Iraqi Parliament's Oil and Gas Committee, confirmed to Kurdistan24 that the committee will host a delegation from the Ministry of Oil to address the challenges facing the Kurdistan Region's oil exports. The discussions will cover the latest developments, ongoing measures, and the relationship between the Ministry of Oil and the Association of the Petroleum Industry of Kurdistan (APIKUR). 
""As the Oil and Gas Committee in Parliament, we will request a clear explanation from the Ministry of Oil regarding the delay in resuming exports from the Kurdistan Region,"" Subhi stated. 
While an agreement has yet to be reached between the Iraqi Oil Ministry, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), and APIKUR, both sides have agreed to hold further meetings to work toward a resolution. However, APIKUR companies have expressed concerns about the current export mechanism proposed by the Iraqi Oil Ministry.

2025-03-21 21:20:36+00:00,"China Strikes at Canadian Exports: Farmers on the Brink of Survival

As of March 8, China has officially imposed new tariffs on key Canadian goods — and farmers are sounding the alarm. Canola oil, meal, and peas now face a 100% tariff, while pork and seafood are hit with a 25% tariff. Experts warn these measures could devastate the agricultural sector and jeopardize thousands of jobs.

China’s actions come in retaliation to Canada’s recently introduced tariffs: 100% on Chinese electric vehicles and 25% on aluminum and steel products. It’s an economic war between the two nations. Canada sought to protect its auto industry from dumping — cheap electric vehicles mass-produced in China with state support. In response, Beijing hit Canadian farmers, who have already been struggling for years due to drought, high costs, and unstable incomes.

Canola, in particular, has been hit hard — a crop that for years ensured stable exports to China. According to Tara Sawyer, chair of Grain Growers of Canada, these new tariffs effectively close the Chinese market. She, like thousands of other farmers, was preparing for spring planting but is now counting losses and fearing for the future of her farm.

Economists confirm: the tariffs will not only slash profits but also lead to market oversupply, price drops, and the potential bankruptcy of many producers. Professor Daniel Trefler of the University of Toronto called the canola tariff “a punishment devised by the Chinese regime,” warning of severe consequences for regions where agriculture is a way of life.

Seafood is also at risk: Canada exports over $1.3 billion in fish to China annually. Unique products like British Columbia’s scallops and Nova Scotia’s elvers are almost entirely reliant on the Chinese market. The Fisheries Council of Canada has already stated that tariffs from both China and the U.S. are effectively cutting Canada off from 83% of the global seafood market.

Even pork producers are feeling the blow: China was Canada’s third-largest pork buyer, purchasing over $43 million worth annually. Canadian Federation of Agriculture president Keith Currie openly said these tariffs hit at the worst possible time.

In response, the federal government has promised support: Agriculture Minister Cody Blois is in talks with the governments of Alberta and Saskatchewan to activate existing risk-management programs. Alberta has already earmarked $4 billion to address economic challenges. Premier Danielle Smith even joked she’s “doubled her bacon consumption in solidarity.” Meanwhile, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia have yet to propose concrete actions, offering only optimistic statements.

Amid all this, farmers are not just calculating financial losses but struggling under immense psychological pressure. “Everyone’s on edge. Things change every day, and we don’t know what’s coming,” Sawyer admits.

Canada is caught in a complex geopolitical game. While defending its interests, it’s paying a steep price. The real question is whether the country can stand by its producers in this moment — or leave them to face global giants alone.",Energy

The US had an approximate $45 billion dollar trade deficit in 2024 because of U.S. purchases of oil, which US refineries convert into tens of billions in profits. 

I don’t believe President Trump would like those profits and accompanying tax revenue to disappear.

Take away the oil trade, and the U.S. has a massive trade surplus with Canada, including their dairy industry which has an $850 million dollar surplus.

The U.S. government also subsidizes their own dairy industry. Farmers sell at a loss if not for the socialist nature of their dairy industry, dependent on government handouts. Not fair!!

General inflation is down. Oil is down 14%. 

Lumber will be one exception to this news. New US Lumber tariffs will match or exceed historical Canadian tariffs of around 15%. Generally, US construction markets bought 60-70% of lumber from domestic markets, the rest from Canada. Presently, lumber futures are up 21% on this news, mostly related to supply constraints and builders stockpiling due to near term disruption concerns.

2025-03-22 19:48:54+00:00,"I promised to post this as we talked about this on my stocks / options space earlier today.

The trade is the bull call

It’s a lower cost alternative to the long call with some advantages and disadvantages 

Let’s you were looking at buying a long call on TSLA ( this is simply an example and not a recommendation to do this trade)

A strike 250 call for April 17 is $17.85

Works great if the stock moves up quickly. What if the call premium is more than you can afford and you would like to be able to give the stock a little more time to move in your direction.

Then use the bull call 

Here is the trade

Buy the April 17 250 call

Sell the April 17 255 call

Your cost is $2.35 instead of $17.85 and you can see that in the image

Advantages

Much lower cost

The time decay ( theta) of the long call by itself is offset by the short call so the passage of time doesn’t hurt you. This gives the stock more time to move in your direction.

Disadvantages

Your profit is capped at 100% 

If the stock moves up explosively then you would make way more in a long call by itself.

Note 

You can do a version of this for a long put as well

Buy a long put

Sell a long put one strike below it.",Energy

Gas production has almost trebled since Gladstone #LNG exports commenced in 2015, and yet prices have tripled. It contradicts their flawed policy. 

Instead, more drilling in Qld's Surat Basin will result in hundreds more water bores drying up and/or becoming contaminated with gas. 

It will result in a decimation of the Great Artesian Basin's future integrity as #CSG companies continue to extract UNLIMITED amounts of water from the #GAB, leading to widespread aquifer drawdown and reservoir compaction (a permanently reduced storage capacity).

2025-03-24 23:34:46+00:00,"President Trump announced 25% tariffs on every country that imports Venezuelan oil.

- Over the last year, there are approximately 195 cargos of Venezuelan oil exported from Venezuela to Europe.

- If you add up China - that's another 90 cargos.

Here's why it matters:

The US is actually introducing a new type of secondary sanctions: it used to be the fact that if you trade in sanctioned cargos- you might end up on the blacklist. For good or bad - -there is a legal bar / onus to that . it's not that automatic to get someone on the ""full blacklist"" (especially in the EU). Also , the accountability was per *company* - a private company could get in or out of the sanctions list.

Now, the US is introducing a *Country* level ""punishment"" - 25% tariff on *countries* of which *companies* import Venezuelan oil. I of course get why this could be effective.

As a member of the @RUSI_org  Maritime Sanctions Taskforce and UK Sanctions Taskforce- this is a big development. It changes time to get sanctioned, accountability and reversibility. Sanctions were always part of the geopolitical game, but now the pace has been upped 10x.

Being here in Singapore and listening to the speakers and the regional players- I believe there is a worry about unpredictability of decisions , cause and effect and its lasting impact on world trade.

If Trump’s 25% import tariff hits, here’s the breakdown for investors — which stocks to watch and which to avoid:
$TSLA $GM $F $STLA $TM $HMC $MBGYY $VLVOF
(1/)

Winners:

1. $TSLA (Tesla)
Built in the USA. Zero import exposure.
25% tariff would give Tesla a major price edge vs. foreign EVs like the BMW i4 or Hyundai Ioniq 6.
(2/)

2. $GM (General Motors)
Massive U.S. manufacturing footprint. Strong SUV/truck portfolio benefits as foreign competitors get priced out.
(3/)

3. $F (Ford)
Same story as GM. Dominates in high-margin U.S.-built trucks. Any tariff tilts the playing field in Ford’s favor.
(4/)

4. $STLA (Stellantis)
Jeep, RAM, and Dodge production is largely domestic. Despite being HQ’d in Europe, key models dodge the tariff hit.
(5/)

5. $DAN, $BWA, $AXL
Auto parts suppliers based in the U.S. stand to gain if OEMs reshore production. Watch Dana Inc, BorgWarner, American Axle.
(6/)

6. $KMX (CarMax)
Used car dealers benefit from new car price inflation. Tariffs = more buyers switching to used inventory.
(7/)

⸻

Losers:

1. $MBGYY (Mercedes), $VLVOF (Volvo), $BMWYY (BMW)
Luxury automakers with high U.S. exposure but mostly foreign production. Imports get slapped with a 25% hike. Margins squeezed.
(8/)

2. $TM (Toyota) and $HMC (Honda)
U.S. production helps, but not enough. Imports like Land Cruiser, Prius, and some CR-V/HR-V trims face price hikes.
(9/)

3. Hyundai/Kia (Not U.S.-listed)
Still heavily import-reliant. Models like the Genesis G80, Hyundai Tucson, Kia EV6 would get more expensive overnight.
(10/)

4. U.S. dealerships repping import brands
Higher sticker prices = fewer buyers = lower dealer margins. Watch out for softening sales at Audi, Mazda, Hyundai dealerships.
(11/)

⸻

Macro Takeaway:
•BUY: $TSLA, $GM, $F, $STLA, $DAN, $AXL
•CAUTION: $TM, $HMC, $MBGYY, $BMWYY
•Tariffs are inflationary: Consumers lose. Used car stocks win.
•Election catalyst: This trade could move fast on policy headlines.

The last pillar of the Japanese economy, the automotive industry, will face a very bad future.

In recent years, there have been many sad news in Japan, such as the sharp rise in rice prices, the boom of the prostitution industry, and the prevalence of syphilis.

Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney confirmed last Friday that his government would keep the emissions cap on oil and gas production put in place by the Trudeau government in November 2024. The Cap aims at reducing emissions from the oil and gas sector, including the Newfoundland offshore sector, to 35% below 2019 levels by 2030-2032, 5 years from now.

The NL government and Industry opposed the Cap saying it will result in curtailed production of the Newfoundland and Labrador offshore oil and gas industry. According to Energy NL the oil and gas sector accounts for 25 percent of the province's GDP, over 40% of all exports, and more than eight percent of all provincial employment. Fishing, forestry and mining combined do not come close to matching the importance of the oil and gas industry to the Newfoundland economy.

This issue should be foremost in the minds of all Newfoundlanders and Labradorians when candidates come knocking on their doors in the next few weeks. Trump tariffs are on again, off again, but Carney/Trudeau suppression of our energy sector is a hard core constant, a defining characteristic of Liberal Party of Canada.

London Metal Exchange raised the APT notation from 345/370 to 350/370. However, no Chinese tungsten exports occurred since Feb 4th, and no export license under the new regulation has been granted, resulting in no spot business.

The enclosed ARGUS graph shows Rotterdam prices rising, while Chinese APT prices remain significantly lower. As Chinese producers remain uncertain about export timelines, they aren't buying material for export, keeping prices low. Still, some Chinese sources indicated this week that inventories are low, requiring renewed concentrate purchasing soon, which they expect will drive domestic tungsten prices upward.

Since the new export regulations started on Feb 4th, tungsten exports dropped 66% from January to February this year and 47% compared to Feb 2024, according to the Chinese Nonferrous Metals Industry Ass. Conversely, China's tungsten concentrate imports in Jan-Feb rose by 30% year-over-year.

2025-03-30 20:00:28+00:00,"🇺🇸 President Trump’s 2018 Playbook is Back Most don’t see it, but history is repeating.

In 2018, Trump launched a wave of tariffs. 
January (50%) - Solar Panels, Washing Machine
March (25%)  - Metals
June - Global trade war

Markets crashed for six months as countries retaliated, and panic set in.

Then, in December 2018, everything reversed. A six-month rally followed, wiping out the entire year’s losses. By July 2019, the Fed ended QT, and the market was primed for a strong 2019–2021 bull run—until COVID derailed it.

Fast forward to today, and Trump is running the same playbook. He restarted tariffs in March, igniting another global trade war. But this time, retaliation is happening faster.

Here's what I think:

1. Markets will likely start recovering by Q3 2025, with the Fed expected to end QT in July. We could see signs of strength as early as March. 

2. By September 2025, the real parabolic bull run begins.

3. Bitcoin’s conservative target sits at $250K, but with Trump bullish on crypto, it could go much higher. 

Key Points to consider:
- US SBR
- SEC is crypto-friendly
- Other countries will FOMO
- BRICS using BTC as international payment
- China is part of BRICS, might unban crypto

PRES. DONALD TRUMP: If Russia – Phase two will be a secondary deal, a second deal. If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia's fault -- which it might not be -- but if I think it was Russia's fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia.

That would be that if you buy oil from Russia, you can't do business in the United States. There will be a 25% tariff on all – on all oil, a 25 to 50-point tariff on all oil.

…

PRES. DONALD TRUMP: If I feel, if we're in the midst of a negotiation, you could say that I was very angry, pissed off, when Putin said yesterday that – you know, when Putin started getting into Zelensky’s credibility, because that's not going in the right location, you understand?

What he wanted – and I mean, he started talking about new leadership. But new leadership means you're not gonna have a deal for a long time, right? But I was talking about – But I was pissed off about it. But if a deal isn't made, and if I think it was Russia's fault, I'm going to put secondary sanctions on Russia.

So that, so that anybody buying oil from Russia will not be able to sell their product, any product, not just oil, into the United States.

Europe's dual position is best illustrated by what Brussels is not doing. By the end of March, EU Energy Commissioner Dan Jorgensen promised to present a master plan for the EU to completely abandon Russian gas supplies.

2025-04-01 23:09:16+00:00,"BREAKING NEWS: CANADA SLAMS BRAKES ON TESLA—BANNED FROM EV REBATES AMID TRUMP TARIFF SHITSTORM AND DODGY CLAIMS

Toronto, Canada – April 1, 2025 – In a ballsy move that’s got everyone talking, the Canadian government has kicked Tesla to the curb, banning it from the Incentives for Zero-Emission Vehicles (iZEV) program and freezing a whopping CAD 43 million in rebate payments [2][3][6]. Why? Because of Trump’s “illegitimate and illegal” U.S. tariffs and Elon Musk’s cozy ties to the former prez, which have turned trade tensions into a full-on dumpster fire [1][4][7]. Oh, and let’s not forget the sketchy-as-hell rebate claims Tesla tried to sneak through just before the program ran dry [3][6][7]. This isn’t a slap on the wrist—it’s a middle finger to Musk and his electric empire.

Trump Tariffs and Musk’s Bromance Spark the Ban

Canada’s had it up to here with Trump’s tariff tantrum, slapping 25% duties on everything from steel to cars, effective today [10]. Enter Tesla, caught in the crosshairs because Musk’s practically Trump’s right-hand man—think Department of Government Efficiency and a $290 million campaign cash dump [7]. Transport Minister Chrystia Freeland didn’t mince words: Tesla’s out of the iZEV program “so long as these bullshit U.S. tariffs are choking us” [2][3]. British Columbia, Nova Scotia, and Manitoba are piling on, axing Tesla from their own EV rebates faster than you can say “Cybertruck” [1][4]. This isn’t just policy—it’s personal, and Musk’s Trump bromance is the match that lit the fuse.

$43 Million Frozen: Tesla’s Shady Cash Grab Under the Microscope

Here’s where it gets juicy: Canada’s holding back CAD 43 million ($30 million USD) in rebates because Tesla’s last-minute claims stink worse than a week-old fish [3][6][7]. Right before the iZEV fund dried up in January, Tesla flooded the system with 8,653 sales claims across four stores—two cars a minute, including when the doors were shut [9]. A single Quebec City dealership claimed CAD 20 million for 4,000 “sales” over a weekend [7]. Dealers and officials are screaming foul, with the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association calling it a “system-gaming heist” that left competitors high and dry, out $10 million [12]. Freeland’s team is now dissecting every damn claim, and no cash is flowing until they’re sure Tesla didn’t pull a fast one [6][8]. Suspicious? You bet your ass it is.

Provinces Join the Pile-On: Tesla’s Out in the Cold

It’s not just Ottawa kicking Tesla’s tires—provinces are in on the action. British Columbia yanked Tesla chargers and batteries from its rebate list, with Premier David Eby snarling, “It’s just for Tesla, and it’s because of Elon Musk” [1]. Nova Scotia’s legislature voted unanimously to ditch Tesla’s $2,000-$3,000 rebates, and Manitoba followed, booting Tesla and Chinese EVs from its $4,000 program [4][14]. This ain’t random—it’s a coordinated “Canada First” gut punch to Musk’s bottom line, all while Trump’s tariffs loom like a dark cloud set to hit April 2 [10]. Tesla’s sales are already tanking—down 70% in January—and this could be the knockout blow [12].

What’s Next? A Trade War Shitshow

Tesla’s ban is Canada’s loudest salvo yet in this escalating tariff war. With Trump’s threats to annex Canada as the “51st state” and Musk’s “Canada’s not real” X posts fueling the fire, the stakes are sky-high [7][9]. The frozen $43 million and rebate blacklist could cripple Tesla’s Canadian market, already wobbling from boycotts and vandalism [14]. Meanwhile, regular Canucks who bought Teslas are left wondering if their rebates are toast too. Freeland’s promised a “line-by-line” probe, but until then, Tesla’s on ice—and Musk’s Trump ties might just cost him more than he bargained for [2][6]. Stay tuned, because this shit’s about to get wild.

2025-04-02 21:57:56+00:00,"Let’s talk about the U.S.–Iraq trade deficit… and how it could unlock IQD redemptions in America.

In 2024, the U.S. had a $5.8B trade deficit with Iraq — importing $7.4B in goods (mostly oil) while exporting just $1.7B.

That deficit? It might be the key to your dinar exchange.

Here’s how:

⸻

Step 1: Iraq Revalues the IQD
The Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) sets a new exchange rate backed by gold, oil, or hard assets.

⸻

Step 2: The U.S. Facilitates Redemption
To stabilize trade and reduce imbalance, the U.S. agrees to accept structured IQD redemptions in return for:
•Crude oil credits
•Trade offsets
•Or U.S. treasury-backed FX settlements

⸻

Step 3: You Exchange Domestically
Your physical IQD is redeemed at licensed U.S. institutions — but backed by an international agreement where Iraq’s surplus (USD holdings from oil) is credited back into the system.

⸻

Why it works:
This strategy allows the U.S. to settle debts through energy partnerships, not inflation.
Iraq cleans up offshore IQD and gains economic legitimacy.
And citizens holding IQD can redeem at a fair rate — without wrecking either economy.

⸻

This isn’t speculation.
This is geopolitics, trade leverage, and macroeconomic chess — and you’re holding a piece of it.

2025-04-03 23:53:52+00:00,"2025, day 94

Good morning from Asia.

All the focus today is on the reaction to the Trump tariffs;

Markets plunged, stocks down, bond yields down, commodities down, oil down a lot, and the dollar down. The least hysterical take was “meltdown”;

Some point out the tariffs are a body blow to “factory Asia” and to globalisation as we’ve known it;

Others point out inflation will rise short term, although if oil keeps falling that will offset a lot; 

Many flag a near-term risk of recession. Yet a collapse in bond yields helps narrow the U.S. fiscal deficit and refinance debts just as a major offsetting tax cuts package looms; and if investment picks up in the U.S. behind the tariff wall, things could theoretically turn around fast. Not so much in global exporters to it now stuck with excess production;

The Financial Times calls the tariffs an “astonishing act of self harm” that will “upend the global order and tarnish US prosperity”;

Germany’s outgoing Economy Minister says the move is as bad as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the reaction must be commensurate. So, lots of big talk and no action for three years, or the recent shift to massive fiscal stimulus?;

One Bloomberg writer says “Liberation Day isolates America from the rest of the world by incentivizing all other countries to trade with each other instead of America. China now has a golden opportunity to beat America at its own game.” By becoming a mass consumption-based importer?!;

Another compares Trump to China’s Ming dynasty that led to “centuries of decline and humiliation”. As the U.S. aims to build ships again rather than burn the fleet, which is what China did back then and “because markets” did to the U.S. shipbuilding industry;

A more balanced view is this is a radical U.S. gamble that changes how we’ve done things for a generation. Markets obviously won’t like it now, but there are bad potential paths for the U.S. and some good ones. For the world reliant on U.S. end-demand it’s as much of a shock as the recent U.S. pivot on Ukraine and security guarantees was to Europe. Could it trigger equally transformative changes?;

Now the next phase starts as President Trump says: “Every country's called us. That's the beauty of what we do. We put ourselves in the driver's seat. If we would have asked some of these countries, almost, most of these countries, to do us a favor they would have said no. Now, they'll do anything for us.”; but

The EU girds for battle, with French President Macron calling to freeze all investments into the U.S. as a start - just as Europe also negotiates with the U.S. over a security guarantee for Ukraine and buys U.S. LNG;

Meanwhile, the Middle East is heating up, Russia-Ukraine isn’t cooling down, and nobody knows what will happen in an Asia now seeing its economic foundations rocked.

Argentina’s oil output could exceed 850,000 barrels per day by year-end, surpassing the record of 847,000 barrels set in 1998.

YPF, the nation’s leading oil company, plans to channel $3.3 billion into Vaca Muerta as part of a $5 billion investment strategy through 2029, focusing on upstream operations and refinery upgrades.

By 2027, oil exports could generate over $15 billion annually, bolstered by projects like the Vaca Muerta Oil Sur pipeline, set to boost capacity to 550,000 barrels daily by mid-2026.

This energy renaissance positions Argentina as a rising global player, leveraging Vaca Muerta’s potential to break records and fuel economic growth.

Up to 1970, imports were 4-5% of the US economy. The 1973 oil shock crisis raised the cost of oil and among other factors, caused imports to surge as a percentage of GDP. This settled with imports at 13-17% of GDP with oil only around 5% of imports, so non-oil goods are clearly a much bigger factor now.

2025-04-06 16:48:35+00:00,"🚨 BREAKING: Wedbush has lowered its price target on Tesla $TSLA from $550 to $315:

“Musk Created Brand Crisis + Trump Tariffs = Perfect Storm For Tesla..PT to $315

The economic tariff Armageddon unleashed by the Trump Administration is a double whammy for Tesla in our view. Tesla is less exposed to tariffs than other US automakers such as GM, Ford, and Stellantis as well as foreign autos...although Tesla still derives a considerable amount of its parts/batteries from sources outside the US including China. This will be a clear cost impact to Tesla in the US and ultimately be passed on to consumers with some demand destruction if these tariffs hold in their current form. The tariffs in their current form will disrupt Tesla, the overall supply chain, and its global footprint which has been a clear advantage over the years vs. rising competitors like BYD.
The bigger worry in our opinion is Tesla's success in China as this key region is the linchpin to the future success of Tesla. The backlash from Trump tariff policies in China and Musk's association will be hard to understate and this will further drive Chinese consumers to buy domestic such as BYD, Nio, Xpeng, and others. Tesla has essentially become a political symbol globally....and that is a very bad thing for the future of this disruptive tech stalwart and the brand crisis tornado that has now turned into an F5 tornado. We now estimate Tesla has lost/destroyed at least 10% of its future customer base globally based on self created brand issues and this could be a conservative estimate. In Europe, this number could be 20% or higher....all self-inflicted by Musk.
Tesla has unfortunately become a political symbol because of Musk and this is a very bad thing for the future of this technology stalwart. With major protests erupting globally at Tesla dealerships, Tesla cars being keyed, and a full brand crisis tornado turning into a life of its own this has cast a dark black cloud over Tesla's stock. The future is so bright for Tesla with Austin's unsupervised FSD, lower-cost vehicles, and of course the autonomous and robotics future....but this is a full blown crisis Tesla is navigating now (along with these tariffs), and it is time for Musk to step up, read the room, and be a leader in this time of uncertainty.
For the stock, the demand destruction for Tesla and brand damage is real and has morphed into something much more concerning over the past few months. The 1Q delivery number was a disaster as we discussed last week but this could be a brutal year ahead if Musk does not exit stage left or take a step back on DOGE in the coming month. We are taking a stab at new reduced estimates for 2025/2026 which could be a moving target with the tariffs, retaliatory, and the China wild card.
Our long standing bull view of Tesla remains, but there is no denying this is a pivotal moment of truth for Musk to turn things around...or darker days are ahead. We have been one of the biggest supporters of Musk and Tesla over the last decade....but this situation is not sustainable and the brand of Tesla is suffering by the day as a political symbol. Musk has been with his back against the wall many times and every time Tesla came out of it and was stronger on the other side...this may be one of his biggest challenges yet to turn around. We are lowering our price target from $550 to $315 to reflect these new softer demand estimates. We maintain our OUTPERFORM rating.”",Energy

2025-04-06 19:47:46+00:00,"🔥WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW about CRUDE OIL🛢️
We always recover from these shocks in crude oil, but it takes time, and this is just the start. Remember, the world economy runs on crude oil, every market is affected by this decline.
You’ll know I trade crude oil. Here’s a look at history that may shed light on what’s in the future. Almost every time oil collapses by 7% or more, it’s either:
🚩A supply shock (too much oil, not enough cuts),
🚩A demand shock (pandemics, recessions, tariffs),
🚩Or a macro panic (financial crashes, credit 
        downgrades).
This week saw oil prices tank more than 10% as President Donald Trump’s tariffs went into effect. A single-day drop of more than 7% in global oil prices is rare but not unheard of. It usually signals something dramatic. the spectre of war (directly involving the U.S.), pandemics, or, in this case, a brewing global trade war.

We have been here before, and not that long ago. In fact, Here are six incidents/events that led to single-day oil price crashes of >7% just since mid-2020.

🚩August 1, 2019 – Trump’s Tariff Threat (-7.9%)
WTI: -7.9% | Brent: -7.0%
President Trump had tweeted out a new 10% tariff on $300 billion of Chinese imports, cratering oil prices as the markets panicked over trade war escalation and a global demand slowdown. 

🚩March 9, 2020 – The Price War Meltdown (-24.6%)
This was the granddaddy of all plunges. After OPEC+ talks fell apart, Saudi Arabia and Russia launched an oil price war just as the COVID-19 pandemic was going global. Crude fell, hard. WTI crashed 24.6% in a single day, marking the second-largest one-day percentage drop in history.

🚩April 20, 2020 – Below Zero (-305%)👈
WTI: From $18.27 to -$37.63 Brent: $25
Just over a month later, global oil markets felt the sting of yet another drop. This was the largest drop in absolute dollar terms in history. WTI literally went negative. This is the now-infamous day crude prices crashed through zero and hit minus $37.63 per barrel for a more than 300% drop. 

The fiasco was exacerbated because the trading software wasn’t set up to handle negative prices there simply wasn’t the capacity to display or execute negative prices. Some systems auto-liquidated positions or froze trading. Sellers were stuck. The initial catalyst, however, were storage tanks that were full, and no one wanted physical delivery in May. The result? The oil market went full Twilight Zone. Brent didn’t go negative (it’s a seaborne crude), but WTI’s drop that day rewrote the rules.

🚩November 26, 2021 – The Omicron Drop (-13.1%)
WTI: -13.1% | Brent: -11.6%
Black Friday 2021 was brutal for oil. News of the new Omicron COVID variant spooked markets, and oil took the brunt. Traders feared more travel bans, lockdowns, and demand destruction. WTI lost over 13% on the day, one of its steepest pandemic-era declines

🚩July 19, 2021- OPEC+ Strikes Output Deal (-7.5%)
WTI: -7.5% | Brent: -6.8%
OPEC+ agreed to boost production by 400,000 bpd. While this eased lingering supply concerns, it was perhaps too much easing and the market interpreted this as too much, too soon—especially with Delta Covid variant headlines spooking demand outlooks.
April 3, 2025 – Tariffs and OPEC Firebomb (-7%)

🚩WTI: -7% | Brent: -6.4%
President Trump’s latest tariff announcement blitzed markets with Liberation Tariffs just as OPEC+ surprised with a 411,000 bpd production hike for May. Prices cratered, with WTI sinking 7% and Brent close behind. The two macro punches on the same day resulted in a case of textbook chaos.

Due to a global market slump triggered by Trump’s trade war and OPEC+ boosting production, the price of Russia’s Urals oil has tumbled near post-invasion lows.

📉 On Friday, Argus Media reported that Urals crude loaded from the Baltic port of Primorsk was trading at $52.76/barrel — far below the $69.70 target in Russia’s 2025 budget.

Even Russia’s own Deputy Finance Minister admitted in March that they now expect an average of $60, which could add another 1% of GDP to the budget deficit.

But let’s be honest — with prices dropping even further, that “deficit” might soon be spelled D-E-F-A-U-L-T.

Maybe it’s time for Moscow to demilitarize… their expectations.

2025-04-08 22:13:37+00:00,"$NIO 💎🙌🏻

Tariffs are affecting NIO, the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company, in a largely indirect manner as of April 08, 2025, given that NIO does not currently export vehicles to the U.S., where some of the most significant tariff increases on Chinese EVs have been implemented. However, the broader implications of tariffs—particularly those imposed by the U.S. and the European Union (EU)—still create ripple effects that influence NIO’s operations, market sentiment, and strategic decisions.

The U.S. imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese-made EVs in May 2024 under the Biden administration, effectively quadrupling the previous 25% rate. This move was designed to protect domestic automakers and counter perceived unfair subsidies from the Chinese government. Since NIO does not sell vehicles in the U.S. market yet (though it has expressed interest in entering North America by 2025), these tariffs do not directly impact its current sales. However, they limit NIO’s potential future expansion into the U.S., as the high tariff wall makes it economically unfeasible to export vehicles from China without significant price hikes that would erode competitiveness against domestic players like Tesla, Rivian, or Ford.

In the EU, tariffs on Chinese EVs were finalized in October 2024, ranging from 17.4% to 37.6% on top of the existing 10% import duty, following an investigation into Chinese subsidies. NIO, identified as a cooperating company, faces a 21% additional duty. While NIO has begun selling vehicles in Europe (e.g., the EL8/ES8 deliveries started in September 2024), its European sales volume remains small compared to its primary market in China. The company has maintained current prices for now but has warned that price adjustments may be necessary if definitive measures are enforced. This could reduce NIO’s competitiveness in Europe against local brands or other Chinese EV makers like BYD (which faces a lower 17.4% tariff) or Tesla (with a 7.8% rate due to its Shanghai factory). NIO’s commitment to the European market remains firm, but the tariffs force it to weigh options like local manufacturing partnerships—something it has hinted at exploring—to mitigate costs.

In China, where NIO delivers the vast majority of its vehicles (e.g., 13,863 in February 2025 alone), tariffs abroad can indirectly affect the company through economic and trade dynamics. If U.S. and EU tariffs escalate into a broader trade war, China’s economy could face pressure from reduced exports in other sectors, potentially softening consumer spending on premium EVs like NIO’s. Additionally, China might retaliate with tariffs on foreign automakers like Tesla, which exports from Shanghai to Europe and elsewhere. This could benefit NIO domestically by making Tesla’s offerings less competitive in China, where Tesla is a key rival. Some X posts suggest this scenario could be a “win-win” for NIO, as it faces no direct U.S. tariff hit and could gain from reduced foreign competition at home.

Investor sentiment toward NIO’s U.S.-listed stock ($NIO) is another indirect casualty of tariff tensions. Trade disputes often spook markets, leading to sell-offs in Chinese ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) like NIO’s, even if the company’s fundamentals remain solid. Posts on X from early April 2025 highlight this volatility, noting NIO’s stock dropping amid tariff news despite its lack of U.S. sales, attributing it to broader economic uncertainty or “tariff tides affecting all ships.” NIO’s valuation—around 0.7x projected 2025 revenues—reflects this cautious sentiment, though it remains attractive compared to Tesla’s 9x multiple.",Energy

The tariffs apply to vehicles that do not comply with the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), or has less than 75% of its content made in North America.  

Will this impact @Tesla vehicles? Maybe.  

A significant portion of Tesla's components are sourced from Canada, the U.S., and Mexico. Some Tesla vehicles likely meet the 75% North American content requirement, making them CUSMA-compliant and therefore not subject to the new tariff.  

Here's a Monroney sticker for a Launch Series Model Y, which has 60% Can/U.S./Mex parts, or strangely 65% if you speak French? In either case, it is less than 75% and would be subject to the tariffs.

While Trump's love for Putin meant no direct tariffs, global ""tariff wars"", nervous markets, and a potential global economic downturn severely impact oil prices.

For Russia, every $1 decline in the price of a barrel of oil annually reduces export revenues by about $2.7bn. 

A drop from $82 per barrel in January to $62 today, if sustained, means on an annualised basis, Russia will lose over $54bn in oil revenues.

A global economic downturn and OPEC's plan to increase supply could easily push Brent crude to $55 or even $50 a barrel by 2026 (according to Goldman Sachs), creating a $73bn or $86.4bn economic shortfall for Russia compared to early 2025.

China has adjusted tariffs on imported goods from the United States, raising rates significantly, reflecting ongoing trade disputes. Additionally, the Chinese government released a white paper addressing various issues regarding Sino-American economic and trade relations. The report underscores China's commitment to open trade principles and highlights areas where the United States has violated agreements under WTO rules.

The State Council Tariff Commission issued a bulletin announcing higher tariffs on U.S. imports effective from April 10, 12:01 PM. The tariff rate will rise from 34% to 84% on all goods originating from the United States. In a related move, the Ministry of Commerce highlighted that America's tariffs measures severely violate WTO rules and emphasized China's commitment to defending its legitimate interests and maintaining multilateral trade system norms.

In addition, the State Council Information Office published a comprehensive white paper titled “China's Position on Issues Concerning China-U.S. Economic and Trade Relations.” The document clarifies the mutual benefit inherent in economic ties between the two nations, addresses obligations under Phase 1 of their trade agreement, and outlines China's adherence to free trade principles and WTO practices, affirming its willingness to engage in equitable dialogue to resolve trade disputes.

Following recent trends, a significant inflow into A- share ETF products totaling more than 190 billion yuan over April 7-8 has reinforced market stability. Concurrently, multiple Chinese state entities announced stock buybacks and shareholder investment to bolster listed companies’ market valuations.

This week, more than 100 A-share companies announced buyback or shareholder increase plans, with a staggering commitment exceeding 10 billion yuan, further signaling robust investor confidence. Notable institutional investors, along with domestic private equity giants, continued reallocating investments into sectors such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence, and new-energy vehicles despite escalated market volatility.

Brokerage firms have also started releasing buyback plans. As of April 9, at least seven companies in the financial sector issued proposals supporting capital stability through repurchased shares. Investment-related actions also extended into agriculture, with CITIC Group boosting its stake in leading agricultural firm Longping Hi-Tech in a 12 billion yuan funding round.

Shifting to market performance, China's A-share indices saw robust gains amid high trading activity. On April 9, 2025, the SSE Index rose by 1.31%, the Shenzhen Component Index increased by 1.22%, and the ChiNext Index gained 0.98%. Furthermore, the Star 50 and BSE 50 Index skyrocketed by 4.31% and 10.27%, respectively, as over 4,500 stocks advanced and around 130 stocks hit the daily limit-up. The total market turnover reached an impressive 1.74 trillion yuan(approximately 267 billion USD).

In the bond market, government bond futures closed slightly higher, demonstrating strength in fixed-income assets. Interbank rates saw a slight reduction, including overnight and seven-day repo rates weighted averages. Traders observed that the PBOC alternated between net injection and net withdrawal of funds through reverse repo operations, aiming to maintain market liquidity without excessively easing monetary conditions.

China has just halted all liquified natural gas imports from the United States leaving tankers in limbo with billions of dollars of contracts.

This will change the landscape of global energy throughout the world and upend critical supply chains.

China has now partnered with Australia to meet their natural gas needs. 

China has learned from Trumps first term and has reduced their vulnerabilities while hitting hard at ours. It’s also going to realign our trade partners as more seek to do business with China. 

What the US saw as a protective measure is being seen by China as a provocation, and a declaration of economic war. 

All that natural gas will need buyers and Europe will be happy to take it on the cheap. We often provided Europe with natural gas when needed, but it was never a secure trade partner due to Russian reliance. With the invasion of Ukraine Europe has been in need of a reliable supplier. Now the US will have to negotiate with Europe to sell that oil.

Europe in return for Chinas sacrifice may find China a more suitable trading partner going forward. Or they might find themselves beholden to them, who’s to say. 

Australia sells their gas at 20% less than the US and it takes 10 less days to get there saving so much money for China. 

American LNG just became a liability as Australia is inking new deals throughout Asia and may soon turn to Europe and cut our LNG out of the picture entirely.

All Trump is done is turned Australia one of our allies into a competitor. I for one am not a fan of losing allies over aggressive trade policies but we will.

//BLUF: FLOODING CONCERNS REMAIN IN KENTUCKY. OIL SPILL CLEANUP CONTINUES IN NORTH DAKOTA. USA/CHINA TRADE SPAT ESCALATES.//

 -----BEGIN TEARLINE-----

-HomeFront-

New York: This afternoon a private helicopter (tail number: N216MH) crashed in the Hudson River in the vicinity of the Holland Tunnel. As of this report, no survivors have been reported, though rescue operations are ongoing.

North Dakota: Tuesday morning a rupture was reported at the Keystone pipeline near Fort Ransom. Roughly 3,500 barrels of oil were spilled in a farmer's field as a result of the pipeline rupture.

Kentucky: Recovery efforts continue following the flooding events of the past week. Severe weather events swept through the region last week, causing widespread damage from the floods. Many areas are still inaccessible due to roads washing out, and debris generally causing challenges with transportation.

Washington D.C. - Tariff shenanigans continue as the White House clarifies the math on the total tariffs on China. So far, the final tally as of this morning is that a 145% tariff on all imports from China is in effect.

-----END TEARLINE-----

Analyst Comments: As the helicopter crash in New York is a developing situation, not much is confirmed. Eyewitnesses state that the aircraft broke up mid-flight, with no obvious signs of distress or mechanical failure before the incident. Analysis of the aircraft's transponder data does not indicate any abnormal flight pattern before the incident that may indicate what happened. 

Of note, misleading videos are already circulating on social media, being pushed by very big accounts. An older video of a similar helicopter showing erratic flight is being falsely claimed to be from this incident, when in reality that footage was from a few years ago. In today's age, misleading, old, or even outright fake video clips always circulate on social media in the minutes after a disaster. Despite this, most people on social media quickly forget the accounts that push fake information, thus continuing the circus the next time something happens.

In North Dakota, no cause was reported for the Keystone pipeline incident. However, the impacts will continue to be felt as the pipeline remains shut down (almost three days after the incident) while repairs are underway. This pipeline transports on average 600,000 barrels of crude oil per day, so any downtime whatsoever will probably negatively impact the prices of petroleum products while repairs continue.

2025-04-11 17:29:57+00:00,"Regarding tariffs, the economic stakes are massive. The U.S. and China trade about $700 billion worth of goods annually, including key exports like smartphones, laptops, soybeans, and gas turbines. Without a deal to de-escalate tensions, higher tariffs will likely disrupt supply chains, raise consumer prices, and strain already fragile global markets.
 
This will be the first real increase in tariffs under the current monetary regime, and the first major departure of the United States from neo-liberal trade policy to mercantilism in most of our lifetimes. The last material increase in US tariffs was with the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, and at that time the US dollar was on the gold standard and Keynes had yet to publish his General Theory.
 
Global trade as % of GDP has been steadily rising for decades as most trade barriers have fallen, bringing the broad global gains from trade between countries with differing specializations, but at the cost of self-sufficiency, the focus of the current administration. Sheltering national industries, either through tariffs or capital controls, is not an uncommon strategy in developing countries, but with varying results: broad success in China’s case and numerous failures in Latin America. It is a less common strategy from a leading developed country and is broadly a sign of weakness, not strength.
 
If the US’ industries were competitive or innovative enough, they wouldn’t need the government’s help to keep them on their feet. This is not to brush aside criticism of other countries’ unfair policies that put the United States at a disadvantage, such as China dumping solar panels on the US, but we have broadly abandoned the global rules-based infrastructure we helped build to resolve them in an ordered way, in favor of blanket tariffs and bilateral diplomacy.
 
Furthermore, trade imbalances are a direct result of the Triffin Dilemma, a concept identified in the 1960s by economist Robbert Triffin, which postulates that the country with the global reserve currency must become a net-exporter of their national currency, naturally resulting in a trade deficit. Imposing tariffs on exporters to the United States, who themselves “buy” dollars when they sell goods to us, makes it harder to export dollars and thus could jeopardize the global reserve status of the U.S. dollar. Stablecoins can be a powerful countervailing force here, which Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged at the March 7 crypto roundtable at the White House, in which he said “we are going to keep the U.S. the dominant reserve currency in the world and we are going to use stablecoins to do that.” While tariffs and mercantilism may reduce dollar demand from foreign governments or sovereigns, stablecoins can be a force to put dollars directly in the hands of global citizens. Can the White House outsmart the Triffin Dilemma? It seems they plan to try.",Energy

In short what this means is - A company can ship their products to an intermediary country, who then ships the products from there to the actually desired location, with the objective of bypassing tariffs on the country of true origin.

This can be taken a step further - Theoretically, new countries can be ""made"" simply to circumnavigate tariffs (done through secession/partition). Yes tariffs would be placed on these new countries, but likewise, they could just create new countries faster than legislation can go into place. We see something similar with regulation around THC, where new strains were ""created"" to bypass regulations.

Would need to do a bit more research, but @grok shared this practices could bypass tariffs, but things do get a bit tricky.

Other loopholes would be in final assembly. Often times there are many products labeled as ""Made in USA"" that are actually manufactured overseas, but final bolts give it this title. Wise companies should be searching for some level of loopholes in the interim of building factories in the US.

“While the U.S. is the top producer of oil in the world, many of its refineries rely on Canadian crude oil to produce oil at current prices, and any tariffs on this imported oil would cause price hikes for gas, diesel, and fuel. All of which, of course, are used to operate ski resorts. 

While there are a handful of ski resorts across North America that have vowed to reduce their fossil fuel usage, such as Aspen Snowmass and Whistler Blackcomb, overall, fossil fuels still largely power ski resorts in the U.S. From snowcats used to groom trails to snowmobiles used by ski patrollers to guest shuttles to get skiers and riders to the mountain, gas and diesel quite literally fuel the resort experience. Add to that the après ski amenities such as lodge operations and restaurants at the mountain and, with price jumps caused by tariffs, you quickly have a snowball effect. 

So either the resort or the consumer has to cover the cost” - https://t.co/QC45xVheqG

Eritrea’s position on the Red Sea is no coincidence – it is a legacy of history and geography, a strategic gift that places our nation at the heart of global trade.

Every day, international cargo ships and oil tankers pass through these waters. Eritrea is not just a coastal state – we are a critical node in the world’s economic arteries.

This key location draws the attention of global powers – the U.S., China, Russia all understand: Whoever holds influence here helps shape the global order.

But Eritrea stands firm. Sovereign. Independent. Uncompromising. We do not bend to pressure – we act with clarity and principle.

Our geography is more than a fact – it is part of who we are. A call to strength, vision, and dignity. Eritrea will defend its interests with pride and purpose.

IRAQI OIL MINISTER EXPECTS PRODUCTIVE MEETING SATURDAY WITH KURDISTAN REGION ON OIL EXPORTS

💥 implementation of the budget law
💥 optimism for reaching an understanding
💥 This round will be productive in signing an agreement and resuming oil exports through the Iraq-Turkey pipeline
💥 deal would lead to the fair distribution of oil revenues among all Iraqis

A delegation from the Kurdistan Region is scheduled to visit Baghdad on Saturday to resume discussions on the long-standing oil export dispute.

The two sides have engaged in multiple rounds of negotiations over the past two years. In February, amendments to the federal budget law provided a legal basis for resuming oil exports. However, disagreements have so far delayed the process.

Iraqi Oil Minister Hayan Abdul Ghani told Channel8 that there is optimism for reaching an understanding with the Kurdistan Region. “There are negotiations with the brothers in the Kurdistan Region on the implementation of the budget law. Several rounds have already been held, and the next will take place this Saturday,” he said.

He expressed confidence that this round would lead to tangible results. “This round will be productive in signing an agreement and resuming oil exports through the Iraq-Turkey pipeline. For context, the halt in exports has caused significant damage to Iraq. Since oil production from the Kurdistan Region is counted within Iraq’s OPEC quota, we have been compensating by cutting production in the southern fields,” he added.

Abdul Ghani also voiced hope that a deal would lead to the fair distribution of oil revenues among all Iraqis.

Despite the suspension of exports for more than two years, the Kurdistan Region continues to produce around 300,000 barrels of oil per day, according to the minister.

Meanwhile, Kurdistan Region Prime Minister Masrour Barzani told Channel8 that Erbil has fulfilled its responsibilities and is now waiting for Baghdad to reach an agreement with the oil companies.

In 2022, Iraq’s Federal Court annulled the Kurdistan Region’s Oil and Gas Law. On March 25, 2023, exports from the Kurdistan Region to the Turkish port of Ceyhan were officially halted.

Officials from the Kurdistan Region estimate the financial losses from the suspension of exports to exceed $23 billion. 

The key obstacles to resuming exports include settling debts owed to oil companies and securing future financial guarantees—issues expected to be on the table during Saturday’s talks in Baghdad.",Energy

Tesla’s dream of mass-producing the Optimus robot at $20K may collapse—without China’s supply chain.

Even Elon can’t escape Made-in-China.

🧵Let’s talk about it.

1. According to Xu Xuecheng, lead scientist at Zhejiang Humanoid Robot Innovation Centre:

“Tesla’s mass-production plan for Optimus is likely to be put on hold.”

Reason? The escalating trade war makes sourcing from China—home to the world’s most cost-efficient robotics supply chain—more difficult and more expensive.

2. From electric vehicles to smartphones to robotics, China’s supply chain is not just cheap—it’s irreplaceable.

Years of infrastructure, labor specialization, and ecosystem clustering can’t be copied overnight.

Even Musk’s $Trillion dreams can get stuck without it.

Standstill shows how Sino-American trade war has spilled into the energy sector

China’s imports of US liquefied natural gas have completely stopped for more than 10 weeks, according to shipping data showing how the Sino-American trade war has spread to energy co-operation.

Since a 69,000-tonne LNG tanker from Corpus Christi in Texas arrived in the southern province of Fujian on February 6 there have been no further shipments between the two countries.

A second tanker was redirected to Bangladesh after it failed to arrive before China imposed a 15 per cent tariff on US LNG on February 10. The tariff has since increased to 49 per cent, making US natural gas uneconomic for Chinese buyers for the foreseeable future.

The freeze on US LNG is a repeat of a block on imports that lasted for more than a year during Donald Trump’s first term as president.

But the impact of the stand-off has potentially far-reaching implications, strengthening China’s energy relationship with Russia and raising questions over the huge expansion of multibillion-dollar LNG terminals that is under way in the US and Mexico.

“There will be long-term consequences,” said Anne-Sophie Corbeau, a natural gas specialist at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “I do not think Chinese LNG importers will ever contract any new US LNG.”

Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, China has imported a relatively low share of its LNG from the US, with Chinese buyers preferring to resell the fuel into Europe for a profit. Last year, only 6 per cent of China’s LNG came from the US, down from a peak of 11 per cent in 2021.

However, Chinese companies including PetroChina and Sinopec have signed 13 long-term contracts to buy LNG from US terminals, some of which run to 2049, according to data from Kpler.

Such long-term deals were essential for getting huge LNG projects off the ground in the US, though Corbeau said developers have recently tried to renegotiate terms to take into consideration rising inflation and the costs from US tariffs.

Gillian Boccara, an analyst at Kpler, said she saw no reason for trade between the two countries to restart in the short term.

“The last time this happened, there was a complete hiatus until the Chinese authorities granted waivers to companies, but that was at a time when gas demand was booming,” she said. “Now we are looking at lower economic growth, and we think the Chinese can withstand the loss of these cargoes for quite a long time.”

China’s ambassador to Russia said earlier this week that China would probably step up its imports of Russian LNG instead. “I know for sure that there are a lot of buyers. So many buyers are asking the embassy to help establish contacts with Russian suppliers, I think there will definitely be more [imports],” said Zhang Hanhui.

We have minerals like potash, gypsum and silica.  Our forests are vast.  Our farms can produce more food than we need to sustain ourselves.  We have the largest reservoirs of fresh water.  

Yet, over the last decade the Liberals have promoted ESG, NetZero, 15 minute cities, the ""great reset"", a green economy and other failed ideologies.  The Liberals have made Canadians dependent on Government with EI, CPP, CERB, UBI and other costly social programs.

We've stopped doing what we were good at, which is extracting resources and making things, in pursuit of activities that are totally without value.

China’s hitting back at Trump’s 145% tariffs by choking off exports of rare earths — the weird metals your car, wind turbine, and fighter jet desperately need.

That includes stuff like dysprosium and terbium which power the super-strong magnets in EV motors and defense tech.

Now the world’s scrambling — most automakers only have 2–3 months of supply left before production hits a wall.

Even Tesla’s sweating. One exec gave the crisis a “seven or eight” out of ten on the oh-no-o-meter.

China basically said: “We won’t match your tariff tantrums, we’ll just hold your supply chain hostage instead.”

Turns out rare earths aren’t rare — just really hard to mine without wrecking the planet. 

And China owns the whole operation.

💥 address critical issues concerning the Kurdistan Region's oil sector, with a primary focus on resuming oil exports
💥 60-day period to select a consulting firm has expired without consensus
💥absence of agreement, the federal government reserves the right to unilaterally appoint the advisory body

ERBIL (Kurdistan24) — A trilateral meeting was convened in Erbil on Sunday among representatives of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil, Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), and the Association of the Petroleum Industry of Kurdistan (APIKUR) to address critical issues concerning the Kurdistan Region's oil sector, with a primary focus on resuming oil exports. Omid Sabah, Chief of Staff of the KRG Council of Ministers, stated that discussions involved the operational activities of oil companies and explored mechanisms to facilitate the restart of exports. The meeting also considered the challenges and proposals presented by these companies to create a conducive environment for resuming oil exports promptly.

Despite the Iraqi Parliament's approval of amendments to the federal budget law on February 2, 2025, particularly Article 12 concerning the resumption of Kurdistan's oil exports, disagreements between the federal government and the KRG have hindered the implementation of these provisions. The amendments stipulate that the federal Ministry of Finance will compensate the KRG for production and transportation costs of oil delivered to the State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO). An international technical advisory body, to be appointed jointly by the federal and regional governments, was tasked with determining the fair cost of production and transportation for each oil field within 60 days of the law's enactment. However, this deadline has passed without an agreement, prompting concerns from Iraqi lawmakers.

Adnan al-Jaberi, Deputy Chairman of the Iraqi Parliament's Oil and Gas Committee, emphasized that the 60-day period to select a consulting firm has expired without consensus. He noted that, in the absence of agreement, the federal government reserves the right to unilaterally appoint the advisory body.

Meanwhile, oil production companies operating in the Kurdistan Region have expressed skepticism toward the Iraqi Ministry of Oil. These companies demand the settlement of outstanding payments for past production, advance payments, and future guarantees as prerequisites for resuming export operations.

The halt in oil exports since March 2023, following a ruling by the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris, has significantly impacted the Kurdistan Region's economy, leading to delays in public sector salaries and reductions in essential services. Baghdad is under increasing pressure to resolve these disputes to restore financial stability and economic growth across Iraq.

As negotiations continue, the resumption of oil exports remains contingent upon resolving contractual disagreements, ensuring fair compensation for production and transportation costs, and rebuilding trust between the federal government and oil companies operating in the region.",Energy

A massive explosion followed by a fire at a major Iranian port — a crucial hub for oil and petrochemical exports near the Strait of Hormuz — has left 25 people dead and injured around 800 others, Mehr News Agency reported on Sunday, citing a local official.

The blast occurred at approximately 11:55am on Saturday at the Shahid Rajaee port facility in the city of Bandar Abbas.

Early Sunday morning, the director general of Hormozgan Province’s crisis management reported that 18 people had been confirmed dead, with the number of injured exceeding 800. He noted that about two-thirds of those hospitalized have already been discharged from medical centers, while the rest continue to receive treatment.

Firefighters were still battling the blaze late into the night. Authorities secured the area and adjacent customs facilities to conduct a probe, suspecting poor chemical storage as a possible cause.

“The cause of the explosion was the chemicals inside the containers,” Hossein Zafari, a spokesperson for the country’s crisis management organization, told Iranian Labour News Agency (ILNA). “Previously, the director general of crisis management had given warnings to this port during their visits and had pointed out the possibility of danger.”

However, the exact cause had not yet been officially determined, government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani told media outlets.

2. Tariff Strategy: Shifting battery suppliers to India/Korea by mid-2026 and expanding Texas assembly mitigates 145% U.S. tariffs (2% margin hit Q2 2025, 6-8% H2 2025). Diversified microinverter production (U.S., India) adds resilience.

According to the latest data, Bandar Abbas is Iran's main fuel oil export terminal and plays a crucial role in the country's oil industry.

Oil Export Volumes
•Recent Export Data: According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Iran exported an average of 1.4 million barrels per day of crude oil and condensate in 2023, rising to approximately 1.5 million barrels per day during the first eight months of 2024.While this data does not specify the exact volume exported through Bandar Abbas, it is a significant contributor to Iran's total oil exports.

•Port Capacity: Bandar Abbas handles a substantial portion of Iran's oil exports, particularly fuel oil. The port's capacity and infrastructure are designed to support large-scale oil shipments, making it a vital component of Iran's energy sector.
Historical Context and Recent Developments

•Economic and Political Significance: The petroleum industry is a cornerstone of Iran's economy, accounting for a significant portion of the country's foreign currency earnings. In 2004, Iran produced 5.1% of the world's total crude oil, generating revenues of US$25 billion to US$30 billion. The oil and gas sector has been the primary driver of economic growth, directly affecting public development projects, the government's annual budget, and foreign exchange sources.

•Recent Incidents: On April 26, 2025, a massive explosion occurred at the Shahid Rajaee section of the Bandar Abbas port, killing at least 28 people and injuring over 800 others. The National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company (NIORDC) stated that the explosion was not related to refineries, fuel tanks, or oil pipelines associated with the company in that area. 

The incident has raised concerns about the safety and security of Iran's critical infrastructure, particularly in light of ongoing negotiations with the United States over Iran's nuclear program.

Like last time, China's stance is that Canada started this and should be first to remove the irritant. But that's false. The Chinese exports benefit from a host of market distortions that lead to overproduction, and that's what Canada's tariffs address.

ERBIL, Kurdistan Region - The Kurdistan Region’s Council of Ministers said on Wednesday that it has met its obligations for resuming the Region’s oil exports, calling on the relevant authorities in Erbil and Baghdad to restart the process “as soon as possible.”
The Council of Ministers held its weekly meeting in Erbil on Wednesday to discuss a range of issues, particularly the Kurdish oil exports which have been suspended for over two years. 
“The Council of Ministers reaffirms its unchanging position in support of negotiations and discussions between both the Oil Ministry and Natural Resources Ministry for the soonest possible resumption of oil exports,” read a statement from the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG).   
“To this end, the Council of Ministers calls on the [Kurdish] Ministry of Natural Resources, the Federal Oil Ministry, oil companies, and [Iraq’s State Oil Marketing Organization] SOMO to continue coordination and negotiation in order to resolve the issues and reach an agreement as soon as possible to resume Kurdistan Region's oil exports and to prevent further financial losses to the general treasury, which have already exceeded tens of billions of dollars,” it added. 
Oil exports from the Kurdistan Region through the Iraq-Turkey pipeline have been suspended since March 2023, after a Paris-based arbitration court ruled in favor of Baghdad, stating that Ankara had violated a 1973 pipeline agreement by allowing Erbil to export oil independently.
Iraq’s foreign minister said on Tuesday that Baghdad is seeking to resume Kurdish oil exports through the Iraq-Turkey pipeline and will “make every effort” to do so.
Myles Caggins, spokesperson for the Association of the Petroleum Industry of Kurdistan (APIKUR), an umbrella group of international oil companies operating in the Kurdistan Region, told Rudaw on Tuesday that Baghdad must provide written documentation of the international consultant’s audit of production and costs.
""I want to make APIKUR’s position clear. Our companies are ready to resume oil exports when we have agreements, and we need agreements for sales and also an agreement for the international consultant that is required by Iraq's budget law,"" he added. 
In early February, the Iraqi parliament approved amendments to the federal budget law, authorizing a $16-per-barrel fee for production and transport costs in the Kurdistan Region - a move seen as a crucial step toward restarting exports.
The amendments also require both the federal government and the KRG to establish an international technical consultancy within 60 days to assess production and transportation costs for oil fields in the Kurdistan Region. If an agreement cannot be reached, the federal council of ministers will appoint the consultancy.

🛢️💰💣🇨🇳🇮🇷🇺🇸
“All purchases of Iranian oil must stop— or you’re done doing business with the U.S.”

That’s not just a @POTUS  Trump policy—it’s a declaration of economic warfare against the enemies of civilization. 

Iran’s only cash crop is oil. That oil funds Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and every other tentacle of radical terror.

Now guess who’s buying 90% of it?
🇨🇳 China.

Yes, the Chinese Communist Party is not just supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine—it is fueling Iran’s war against Israel and the West. 

March 2025 alone? $1.8 BILLION in Iranian oil imports—disguised through Malaysia. That’s not trade. That’s terrorism laundering.

But not @POTUS  Trump. 
Under Trump’s first term, Iran’s production crashed to 400,000 barrels/day. Under Biden, it skyrocketed back to 3.3 million. That’s a pipeline of blood money.

With secondary sanctions and targeted tariffs, Trump is drawing a red line where it hurts most: the wallets of tyrants and terrorists.

This isn’t just foreign policy. It’s moral policy.

“Woe to those who call evil good and good evil.” — Isaiah 5:20

It’s time we stop funding evil—even indirectly.

Let China scream. Let Iran rage. Let the elites panic.

1) Trump just announced that any country buying oil from Iran will be completely banished from conducting any trade with America.

2) China is the No. 1 purchaser of oil from Iran. Therefore, China is, as of today, banished from all trade with America.

3) Trump specifically said, ""They will not be allowed to do business with the United States of America in any way, shape, or form."" Unless his words no longer mean anything, this is a policy announcement of a complete economic embargo against China.

4) It was a U.S. naval embargo against Japan in 1941 that provoked Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and engineered American support for joining the escalating war in the Pacific. Now, Trump is repeating a similar tactic for China.

5) It's clear to me that Trump hopes China will lash out like Japan did in WWII, so that Trump's team of warmonger neocons can have a justification to launch a whole new war with China.

6) Trump is desperately trying to end the war with Russia so that he can ""sequence"" the three conflicts (China, Iran, Russia) and fight only one of them at a time.

The United States has introduced a new wave of steep tariffs on solar panel imports from Southeast Asia, in a move that is deepening trade tensions and triggering alarm across the Asia-Pacific region. The tariffs - ranging from 34% to a staggering 3,521% -target producers in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, following a year-long investigation prompted by U.S. manufacturers’ complaints of market distortion through cheap, Chinese-subsidized solar components.

Announced by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the tariffs include both general and company-specific rates: 34.41% on Malaysian panels, 375.2% for a producer from Thailand, and 395.9% for Vietnam. Cambodia was hit particularly hard, with general tariffs of 651.85%. Two companies—Hounen Solar and Solar Long PV-Tech—face extraordinary rates as high as 3,521%, effectively pricing them out of the U.S. market. These duties come on top of the existing 10% tariff on most imports and any reciprocal tariffs already in place.

The targeted companies represent about 77% of solar module imports into the U.S., according to Bloomberg. Analysts warn that other nations, including Indonesia, India, and Laos, may face similar measures later this year, as Washington intensifies scrutiny of its green technology supply chains.

The move has sparked concern across Asia, particularly among Southeast Asian economies. During the Asian Development Bank’s annual meeting in Milan, finance ministers and central bank governors from ASEAN and its dialogue partners - China, Japan, and South Korea (collectively ASEAN+3) - issued a carefully worded but pointed statement.

“Escalating trade protectionism weighs on global trade, leading to economic fragmentation, affecting trade, investment and capital flows across the region,” the ASEAN+3 officials said in their joint communiqué. The statement did not name the United States directly, it reaffirmed the bloc’s commitment to “a rules-based, free, fair and transparent multilateral trading system.”

As the global economy becomes increasingly fractured along geopolitical lines, the latest U.S. tariffs highlight the growing challenges faced by middle-power economies caught between strategic competition and supply chain realignment. The ASEAN+3 response signals a broader unease over unilateral protectionist measures and a desire to uphold stability through international cooperation and open markets.",Energy

In 2018 Venezuela minted a crypto called the $PETRO but was too early IMO. If Kuwait or Saudi minted a oil backed crypto pegged to a barrel of oil it will be used for oil trade. 

IMO: @Tether_to should mint an oil backed token.

@grok: The only concrete example of a country attempting to back a currency with oil is Venezuela’s $Petro, launched in 2018. While the Petro was claimed to be backed by Venezuela’s oil reserves (one Petro = one barrel of oil), its implementation was ineffective due to a lack of transparency, limited adoption, and eventual abandonment by 2024. No other country has successfully backed a currency with oil in the formal sense, though oil-rich nations often rely on oil revenues to support their currencies indirectly (e.g., Saudi Riyal, Kuwaiti Dinar).

Answer: Yes, Venezuela attempted to back a currency with oil through the Petro, launched in February 2018. The Petro was claimed to be backed by Venezuela’s oil and mineral reserves, with each unit tied to the value of one barrel of oil. However, the initiative largely failed due to a lack of transparency, limited adoption, and its eventual abandonment by 2024. No other country has successfully backed a currency with oil, though oil revenues often support the economies of petrocurrency nations like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.",Energy

China's financial markets opened on a positive note, with high-level Sino-US trade talks drawing significant attention. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng is set to meet U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen during his visit to Switzerland. The Ministry of Commerce stated that China has agreed to engage in dialogues with the U.S. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasized the necessity for the U.S. to stop exerting pressure tactics.

Yellen expressed optimism over potential progress in trade negotiations in the coming weeks and remarked on the unsustainable nature of the 145% tariffs imposed on Chinese goods during the Trump administration. Additionally, Chinese A-share listed companies reported robust first-quarter results, with 75.46% achieving profitability—showcasing the resilience of China's economy.

On the domestic macroeconomic front, Finance Minister Lan Fo'an highlighted that China is committed to proactive macroeconomic policies to meet its 2025 growth target of approximately 5%. However, the Caixin China Services PMI in April fell to a seven-month low, signaling a slowdown in business expansion. Data from the State Taxation Administration revealed accelerated investment in engineering projects in the first quarter, and the May Day holiday saw domestic tourists' total spending, grow by 6.4% year-on-year, with 314 million domestic tourism trips—a 6.4% increase compared to the previous year.

In financial policy updates, the State Council's Information Office announced a forthcoming press conference to outline a comprehensive financial policy package aimed at stabilizing market expectations. Vice Governor of the PBOC, Xuan Changneng, stated that the country is advancing legislation on deposit insurance law to strengthen its core deposit insurance functions.

In domestic economic developments, first-quarter earnings of A-share listed companies reflected a strong start, with 75.46% of enterprises reporting profits, underscoring the country's economic momentum. This aligns with China's 2025 GDP growth target of around 5%, as reiterated by Minister of Finance Liu Kun, who also pledged to further open China's economy to the global market.

A-share markets saw significant upward momentum on the first trading day after the May Day holiday. The SSE Index rose 1.13%, closing at 3,395 points, while the Shenzhen Component Index gained 1.84%, and the ChiNext Index advanced 1.97%. The broader Wind All China Index surged by 1.62%. Total market turnover expanded to 1.36 trillion yuan, with nearly 5,000 stocks seeing gains. Chinese bond markets were also active, though the main treasury bond futures contracts saw mixed movements: the 10-year bond futures declined by 0.16%, while the 5-year bond futures slipped 0.09%.

The last 4 weeks have been the lowest trade frequency I have had, I believe in my career. 

While I’m usually a scalper who gets atleast a trade in a day, I have found myself stepping off the gas naturally, I wouldn’t call it burn out more so intuition telling me things aren’t fully favorable. 

I will say it’s a very tough market and not easy to trade in. But it’s also very manageable at the same time, you just have to adapt. 

During this time, my mental clarity has peaked immensely. My winrate is in the top portion of my average and I’ve been at peace in every area of my life. On and off the charts, I see so many people who no matter what the market presents try and force a trade because they feel lazy if they don’t. 

I used to be to be the same way, it wasn’t until the last 4 weeks I’ve realized this is the farthest from the truth. The market will always be there, alive and well. It’s important to always prioritize yourself, your mind is the number 1 edge in this game.

Having a dynamic tariff for your power supply saves you a ton of money if you are flexible when you charge your vehicle, home battery, computer, smartphone or electric gardening tools and that's exactly what I'm doing right now.

The average electricity price for households in Germany in 2025 is expected to be on average 27.12 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) for an annual consumption of 5,000 kWh.

I currently save 78% of the average electricity costs because I use a dynamic tariff and last week I filled my 100 kWh car battery with 4 cents per kWh and tomorrow between 12 and 3pm its for free. 

That would be today €4 for a full charge and tomorrow its for 3 hours €0. To be precise its even negative -10 cents so I'm not sure if they even pay me for charging! 😂

Because I always have full transparancy and am flexible I just decided to switch my vehicle charging session to tomorrow because I'll pay nothing for it.

Also, from 1 June, the tariff will be changed from the current hourly adjustment to a quarter-hourly adjustment, which will save me even more money.

I don't usually advertise for companies, but I have only found one provider that offers me these cost savings and that is Tibber and I'm really happy with them.

If you are flexible with your electricity consumption and want to save money then Tibber can also be an attractive provider for you. When you use my code below, you will receive €50 credit and yes, I will also receive the same amount.

I'm really enthusiastic and wouldn't be publishing this here if it wasn't a really excellent service that also helps to unstressed the 🇩🇪 German and 🇪🇺 European electricity grids. So you even do something good by saving money.

2025-05-12 22:55:44+00:00,"🚨IRAQ PULLS BACK THE OIL: RESET IN MOTION, DINAR UNDER WATCH🚨

Baghdad to slash crude exports to 3.2M bpd in May & June — down from 3.42M

Reason? OPEC+ overproduction compensation — strategic play to balance 411K bpd surge from others

Iraq’s 2025 budget assumed 3.5M bpd @ $70/barrel — tightening could blow a hole in fiscal math

IQD now under pressure — 1,320 per USD and drifting

Oil = 90% of Iraq’s income. Lower barrels = lower dollar inflow = FX volatility ahead

Kirkuk field test adds 1,000 bpd — a drip in an ocean

Regional tremors: This move signals alignment with Saudi, Russia, & the petrodollar bloc as Iran tensions persist

Debt, reserves, and dollar diplomacy are all back on the table

♟️ GEOPOLITICAL DECODE: Iraq isn’t just cutting oil—it’s buying time on the board. A Dinar reset may be closer than headlines suggest. OPEC’s lever is currency.

⚠️ Watch oil, watch FX, WATCH THE DINAR. This is how resets unfold.

China has emerged as Saudi Arabia’s largest trading partner and the world’s leading importer of crude oil, while Saudi Arabia stands as China’s primary trade partner in the Middle East and its second-largest global crude oil supplier. In 2024, bilateral trade between the two countries reached $107 billion—surpassing Saudi Arabia’s combined trade with the European Union ($75 billion) and the United States ($26 billion). This shift underscores a broader realignment of Saudi Arabia’s economic ties toward Asia, particularly in the context of China’s growing influence in global energy markets.

From 2000 to 2024, Saudi-China trade expanded at a remarkable 15.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), soaring from just $3.1 billion to $107 billion. Over the same period, trade with the EU grew at a 4.5% CAGR (from $26 billion to $75 billion), while trade with the U.S. increased at a modest 1.0% CAGR (from $21 billion to $26 billion). These figures highlight China’s rapidly rising share in Saudi Arabia’s global trade portfolio.

attempted to attack a merchant ship flying the Gabon flag, which was sailing through the neutral waters of the Gulf of Finland to one of the ports of the Leningrad Region.

 Despite threats from the ""Pirates of the Baltic Sea"" to ram the vessel and two attempts to land troops from a helicopter, the crew of the merchant ship JAGUAR did not succumb to provocations and continued on its course.

 This time, the brave crew of the ship under the Gabon flag did not succumb to provocations, but on April 11, the tanker KIWALA under the Djibouti flag was illegally detained (essentially seized), as a result of which a Chinese citizen and 23 Mauritian citizens were effectively taken captive.

It is characteristic that Estonians are again involved in the provocation, whose history shows that they understand only force. The Estonian people have lived on the islands of the Gulf of Finland for centuries (almost their entire history), and all the cities of today's Baltic republic were founded by Russians, Germans and even Danes (Tallinn means ""Danish fortress"").

Also, for centuries, the Germans considered the Estonian people ""Untermensch"", who were not allowed to visit certain territories, nor even to move freely around modern Estonian territory. Estonia owes its culture and statehood exclusively to RUSSIA.

Thus, as part of the fight against German influence, even during the times of the Russian Empire, Estonian national societies were supported in every possible way, on the basis of which the future independent state grew.

During the Soviet era, the Baltics were considered a kind of ""showcase"" where huge amounts of money were invested. Gratitude?!

 Those who call themselves representatives of the Estonian state understand only force, and when the first coffins with provocateurs return to their mothers and widows , then the ""merchant fleet of Gabon"" will be 100% able to move freely in the waters of the Gulf of Finland.

 And here it is important to understand that in this case no NATO article protects provocateurs. The alliance charter talks about protection, and here one of the members of the military bloc decided to attack peaceful Gabon...

The minister emphasized that over 60% of Russian oil exports pass through the Baltic Sea.

In turn, new German Foreign Minister Johann Wadeful, in an interview with Welt am Sonntag, called the Russian “shadow fleet” a threat to German security and confirmed the EU’s plans to impose new sanctions on it.

“As neighboring countries, NATO and the EU, we are countering hybrid threats with all our might, including through additional patrols in the Baltic Sea. In the Baltic Sea region, Russia threatens us all. Torn cables, disrupted signals and suspicious vessels cause us serious concerns. Sanctions will also help Ukraine, as the ‘shadow fleet’ transports oil every day, which Russia sells to circumvent sanctions,” Wadeful said.

We've been talking about the shadow fleet for years.

2025-05-18 09:14:09+00:00,"🚨BARZANI MEETING IN DC “A SIGNIFICANT VISIT”

💥 build an enduring partnership grounded in security, sovereignty, and shared prosperity

Timmerman believes that President Trump could favor Erbil over Baghdad in future disputes—especially in matters of oil exports and regional influence. “if I were to make a guess, I would say that president Trump would come out on the side of Erbil over Baghdad [...] Right now, Baghdad is being, has been infiltrated for years and years by Tehran, by the Iranian regime, so that's going to be the point of conflict.”

He cited efforts to reopen the Ceyhan pipeline for Kurdish oil exports to Europe via Turkey as a test case for U.S.-Kurdish cooperation. “[Prime Minister] Barzani has very good relations with the Turkish government, and that will help. And President Trump has very good personal relationships with President Erdogan. So I think that's the way that they would both like to go [...] but then they would have to get the agreement of Baghdad.”

The broader vision Timmerman laid out involves integrating the Kurdistan Region into a regional defense network against Iranian expansionism. While he acknowledged political constraints due to Iraq's federal structure, he stressed that long-term U.S. interests lie in seeing a unified, professional Peshmerga army and a Kurdish government that can contribute to collective regional security.

“I think the United States would like to see the Peshmerga as a united force, as a single force, not as party militias, but as a single government force, to express the will of the KRG government as a whole,” he said.

“I think also, they would like to see a, you know, a global or I should say a regional, air defense system. I'm not sure that they're ready yet to bring Kurdistan into that because of the relationship with Baghdad. Again, Baghdad is infiltrated by the Iranian regime, and that is a severe problem. But I think, ultimately, that would be the goal to see, the KRG as part of a regional alliance to defend the interests of freedom-loving countries against the Iranian regime,” he added.

Asked whether the Kurdistan Region could realistically seal its borders from Iranian infiltration, Timmerman responded with guarded optimism: “I hope your Prime Minister will ask for assistance from Washington to help seal the borders with Iran, so the Iranians can no longer infiltrate, can penetrate, and can do damage to, your citizens, inside the Kurdish region.”

Timmerman emphasized that peace and stability in Kurdistan are not merely regional concerns but strategic priorities for the United States. He noted that the Kurdish Region, as part of Iraq, is demonstrating that a moderate, non-radical, pro-Western polity can exist in the Middle East, adding that it is in America's interest to ensure that this continues.

For Kenneth R. Timmerman, the choice is clear: reinforce the U.S.-Kurdistan alliance, resist Iranian encroachment, and build an enduring partnership grounded in security, sovereignty, and shared prosperity.

The idea of full control, no middlemen, and open access? It felt like the future.

But then reality hit.

Every trade came with a gas fee.

Every click brought a new wallet pop-up.

Figuring out how to use the DEX itself was even another challenge.

It wasn’t just confusing, it was frustrating.

And I wasn't alone.

A lot of people want to try DeFi, but the complexity pushes them away.

──────── ◁ II ▷ ────────

I did a little research to see if there could be a way out. An app, platform or anything at all that could make things easier.

I came across @infinex and honestly, it felt different.

The interface felt like a centralized exchange – Simple, clean, familiar.

But behind the scenes? It was still fully decentralized.

No one holds your funds. You stay in control.

No more juggling wallets or stressing about gas fees on every action.

Just smooth, non-custodial trading that actually makes sense.

@infinex took everything I love about DeFi, made it usable and even more easier to use.

The best and worst performers of 2025:
- worst performing asset YTD = oil (-12%)
- best performing = gold (21%)
- best performing currency = Russian ruble (+41%)
- best stock market = Poland (28%)
- both Tel Aviv & Tehran stock exchanges soaring to all-time high
Big geopolitics = big price action = “peace trades” outperforming “war trades” in 2025.

The 3 big levels:
- 30-year US Treasury 5%
- US dollar DXY index 100
- SOX (Semiconductor) index 5000
For now, stocks have patiently ignored the latest spike in yields, another bout of “up-in-yields, down-in-US$” should Trump lose the long-end would lead to the next stock sell-off. The 30-year Treasury yield of 5% holds for now. Meanwhile, confirming the fear and loathing for anything with duration, long-duration biotech (XBI) is now at the lowest level vs risk-bullish broker-dealers (XBD) since Oct'07, and shows the ABB “Anything But Bonds” consensus remains deeply entrenched. 

Biggest picture: the next bull market will rest on 3 main pillars: 
- weaker US dollar
- US bond yield top
- China economic recovery
and nothing will work better in this environment than Emerging Market stocks (note EM ex. China index up 20% past month, finally set to break out of 20-year trading range).

Fund flows:the most notable feature of the last week is that US equities had their first inflow since the Liberation Day dump, to the tune of $19.8 billion. Some of the other highlights of the last week: $25.2bn to stocks, $13.1bn to bonds, $0.9bn to crypto, $0.4bn from gold, $17.5bn from cash:
- Gold on course for record $85bn inflow year
- US equities on course for $416bn inflow…2nd biggest year
- US large cap on course for record $521bn inflow
- US small cap on course for record $68bn outflow
- European equities on course for $110bn inflow…biggest since '15

Dear President Trump, Senator Marco Rubio, and the U.S. Department of State,
@POTUS
@realDonaldTrump
@SecRubio

A recently surfaced document—allegedly obtained through a cybersecurity breach—has unveiled deeply troubling evidence of large-scale illicit oil transactions orchestrated by entities affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Iranian regime. The document exposes unauthorized sales of LPG and petroleum products below market rates, conducted off-the-record and without transparency, in blatant violation of international sanctions.

What’s most alarming is the total absence of any official accounting regarding the volumes sold, destination ports, or proceeds generated. This opaque mechanism not only evades U.S. sanctions but also finances the IRGC’s terrorist activities across the Middle East and beyond.

We urge the United States to:

Launch a thorough investigation into the identified shipping and inspection companies complicit in these trades.

Impose additional targeted sanctions on all individuals and entities involved in these covert operations.

Amplify international awareness of the IRGC’s financial network that enables repression inside Iran and aggression abroad.

This revelation must not be ignored. It is a test of the free world's resolve to uphold accountability and dismantle the economic lifelines of authoritarian regimes and designated terrorist organizations.

…Marks One Year of Advance Ruling Implementation

The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has reaffirmed its commitment to promoting seamless and sustainable trade operations, with a renewed focus on facilitating the importation of renewable energy technologies.

The Comptroller-General of Customs (CGC), Adewale Adeniyi, who was represented by Deputy Comptroller-General of Customs (DCG) Caroline Niagwan, in charge of the Tariff and Trade Department, made the pledge in Lagos on Monday, 19 May 2025, during the 2025 edition of the NCS Trade Facilitation Stakeholder Consultative Forum, which also commemorated one year anniversary of the Advance Ruling Programme.

Held under the theme “Trade Facilitation Measures for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Technologies,” the forum brought together key industry stakeholders, development partners, and government officials to explore Customs’ evolving role in supporting Nigeria’s transition to a low-carbon economy.

Delivering the keynote address, DCG Caroline Niagwan described trade facilitation as central to Customs’ contribution to national development and global sustainability efforts.

“With the increasing volume of global trade, it has become imperative for Customs administrations to adopt mechanisms that support the seamless flow of legitimate trade. Such mechanisms are essential not only for sustaining international commerce but also for enabling small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to benefit from cross-border trade,” said DCG Niagwan.

She highlighted key initiatives introduced by the NCS to simplify and modernise Customs operations, including the Unified Customs Management System (UCMS), codenamed B’Odogwu, the Advance Ruling System, and the Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) Programme.

On Nigeria’s environmental obligations, the DCG reiterated the NCS’s support for the Green Customs Initiative and multilateral environmental agreements such as the Montreal Protocol and the Paris Agreement.

“The Nigeria Customs Service plays a pivotal role in supporting these national objectives by facilitating the importation of renewable energy technologies and implementing fiscal measures that promote a shift away from fossil fuels, with the ultimate goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2060,” she stated.

As part of the Advance Ruling Programme anniversary celebration, the DCG reaffirmed the Service’s commitment to fostering efficient, secure, and sustainable trade operations.

A key highlight of the event was the official launch of the Handbook on Import and Export Procedures for Renewable Energy and Energy-Efficient Technologies, which aims to provide guidance to stakeholders and traders on Customs processes applicable to clean energy equipment.

In a goodwill message, Markus Wagner, Country Director for Nigeria and ECOWAS at GIZ, represented by Duke Benjamin, commended the NCS for its strategic foresight. He remarked that the initiative underscores the critical role of Customs in advancing Nigeria’s renewable energy aspirations. “Today’s launch represents another significant step towards improving the ease of doing business in Nigeria,” he added.

Stakeholders present at the forum also shared testimonials on the positive impact of the Advance Ruling Programme, applauding the NCS for its innovation and responsiveness to the trading community's needs.",Energy

“California Republicans are launching an investigation into the Low Carbon Fuel Standard update that is expected to increase the cost of gasoline by 65 cents per gallon — impacting not just California, but the parts of Nevada and Arizona that rely on the Golden State for fuel — on July 1. That’s the middle of the peak summer driving season.

“CARB and the Governor pushed an expensive gas price hike behind closed doors, ignored public input, and misled Californians about the real cost,” said Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones, R-San Diego. “We believe their real goal is to drive gas prices so high that working families have no choice but to buy electric vehicles, whether they can afford them or not. The public deserves the truth, and we intend to shine a light on this radical agenda.”

2025-05-25 14:02:16+00:00,"Three months ago, @defidotapp launched to fix what’s broken in crypto: the complexity.

No gas fees.
No bridges.
No wallet hell.
Just one platform, where anyone can trade any token, on any chain, with full self custody.

Today, it’s one of the fastest growing platforms in DeFi:

•  $10B+ in total volume across spot and perps
•  Top 5 in DEX volume days after launch
•  300K+ active users onboarded without a token

And they’re not slowing down.

Perps trading is live, backed by @HyperliquidX infra:

Gasless leverage. Real time PnL. Full control.
A CEX grade experience, all without the custody risk.

But the real evolution?
It’s not just what they built, it’s what they’re giving back.

Enter $HOME!
A new kind of token for a new kind of platform.

Not another governance ghost town. Not just a discount chip.

$HOME gives the DeFi App community actual power over fees, product priorities, and protocol incentives.

From day one, token holders will vote on:

•  Swap and perps fee models
•  Treasury strategy (buybacks, rewards, or both)
•  App features and integration priorities
•  Token utility like staking boosts, bribes, or reward tiers

$HOME governs the product AND evolves itself.

Most DeFi tokens govern nothing,
and most CEX tokens give you no voice.

This does both.

And with 45% of $HOME allocated to users and the ecosystem, real ownership is the model, not just the pitch.

What’s next?

•  Mobile apps for iOS + Android
•  One click deposits into Aave/Compound
•  Staking mechanics with XP boosts
•  Governance forum + onchain voting

https://t.co/fBm33VnjDR is already live, scaling, and onboarding hundreds of thousands.

$HOME is the mechanism that will let users shape what comes next.

This is more than just another token.
It’s the power to shape defi’s super app, from the inside.",Energy

Iraq’s oil exports to the U.S. have plunged—from 229K bpd (May 10) to just 85K bpd last week. This steep drop aligns with Iraq’s compliance with OPEC+ cuts but also signals deeper shifts.

🚨 Baghdad nullified $110B in Kurdish-U.S. energy deals

🚧 Pipeline exports via Turkey remain blocked

📉 IMF projects weaker current account for Iraq in 2025

💱 Pressure mounts on the Iraqi dinar amid falling USD inflows

Historically, the U.S. took 9.4% of Iraq’s oil. By April 2025? Just 4.64%. The bulk now flows to India and China, as Iraq leans into non-dollar trade—fueling de-dollarization narratives.

This isn’t just a supply issue. It’s a geopolitical reset.
As internal disputes between Baghdad and Kurdistan deepen, Iraq’s oil strategy is shifting—away from the West and toward Asia. This not only alters trade balances but may chip away at USD dominance in global energy markets.

IEA projects global oil demand to slow in H2 2025, compounding Iraq’s revenue concerns. The dinar’s stability and Iraq’s long-term trade alliances now hang in the balance.

In February alone, the EU bought about €2 billion worth of oil, gas, and uranium from russia.

Trade revenues allow putin to allocate 6.3% of GDP to the military industry, which is about 40% of the state budget.

To understand the legal jeopardy Tesla would face, here is Grok's very clear conclusion in it's analysis of the strategy:
""Conclusion:
A Nasdaq-listed company can legally repurchase its shares under strict conditions (Rule 10b-18) and sell shares if compliant with registration and antifraud rules. However, actively trading its own stock to exploit dips and highs risks violating insider trading and market manipulation laws, especially if MNPI is involved or the activity misleads investors. Legal counsel and adherence to SEC regulations are critical to avoid liability.""
If you are interested in the detailed analysis, here is the full Grok prompt and response.  https://t.co/iDhYcFK4tl
However, what Grok does NOT analyze is the prospect of a full scale class action suit being brought by aggresive law firms on almost any/every trade conducted by the company (even those, and especially those, that make profits!) There is a reason that companies stick to buying their own shares strictly under the SEC Rule 10b-18 share buy back safe harbor, and almost never because they wish to ""buy the dip"". That form of trading almost automatically implies MNPI, even when none is involved! This is why Directors and Senior Managers try to only buy or sell shares according to a published plan under safe harbor rules. 
This is a really bad idea: the only consolation is that it would NEVER be approved by the Legal Counsel or the Board of Directors.",Energy

Traditional Scalps: $78,801
-Notable trades were JZ 5/12, GWH 5/30, KIDZ 5/1, GSIW 5/14, AFMD 5/16.

Takeaways:
-Staying at screens all day really paid this month with $25k of pnl coming in the last 2 hours of the day.

-Be more patient off the open. I started 10 days this month in the red so I need to recognize weakness there and slowdown for the time being.

Other mentions:
-I changed my tradervue settings from 'normal' to 'split when possible' which is the reason for the higher trade count this month. I did this because I wanted to compare my stats with my friends on tradervue who use the 'split when possible method'.

-Some of my GME swing trade profits were realized during April which is why my large cap pnl is 39k for the month even though the total trade pnl was higher.

Once daily transaction volume reaches 144,000, Zano’s supply becomes deflationary—meaning fewer coins are available over time. The combination of increasing demand and decreasing supply creates upward pressure on price.

Zano is more than just a deflationary asset. It is the foundation of a sovereign, decentralized, and private economy. With Zano, you can:

1. Use the world’s first private algorithmic stablecoin — $fUSD
 
Preserve your privacy while rejecting US Treasury-backed stablecoins. $fUSD is overcollateralized by Zano, not by fiat or central banks, making it the first stablecoin aligned with freedom rather than financial surveillance.

2. Make transparent blockchains private
 
Trustlessly bridge Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash—blockchains representing over $2.3 trillion in market cap—to Zano using Confidential Layer, turning them into truly private assets.

3. Buy and sell anywhere with privacy
 
Trade goods and services globally without third parties. Zano Bay enables end-to-end encrypted commerce directly on the blockchain—no middlemen, no exposure.

4. Mint and use private NFTs
 
Create and trade non-fungible tokens without compromising privacy. See it in action at obscura(dot)art.

5. Accept Zano for your business
 
Start taking Zano easily through zano(dot)cash, a privacy-first solution for merchants.

6. Tokenize and privately trade any asset
 
From real estate to collectibles, tokenize and exchange anything without banks, brokers, or surveillance. Zano’s peer-to-peer exchange enables direct, private value transfer.

Zano is not a speculative token. It’s the infrastructure for a new economic model—voluntary, decentralized, and private. It is the answer to CBDCs/Stablecoins as backdoor CBDCs. 

As usage grows, so does value. Exit surveillance finance and empower privacy with Zano.",Energy

Imagine a world where your car can pay for its own charging, your home appliances trade energy with your neighbor’s solar panels

And a fleet of delivery drones organize themselves to avoid traffic and reduce emissions 
All without human intervention.

It might sound futuristic, but we’re already taking the first steps into that world. 

The real shift isn’t just about machines becoming smarter. 

It’s about them becoming economically active, able to make decisions, own value, and participate in the systems that shape our lives.  

This transformation is about how we, as people, interact with the world around us.

Up until now, most of the “smart” devices we use — phones, appliances, vehicles — are still deeply dependent on centralized systems. 

They collect our data, send it to corporations, and leave us with little control or benefit. 

But what if machines could act on their own — earning, spending, and collaborating with each other, just like people do in an economy ?

A world where devices don’t just serve us, but actively participate in building smarter, fairer systems around us.

That’s where @peaq comes in.  $PEAQ
Think of it as the digital foundation for this new kind of machine-powered society 

A kind of Internet for machines, but with built-in trust and economic logic. 

peaq allows machines — whether it’s a car, a robot, or a sensor 

To have a digital identity, to earn money for the work they do, and to spend or invest that income without needing a middleman.  

It’s not about replacing people. It’s about freeing up possibilities:

🔹Giving small communities the power to manage local energy with smart meters and solar panels.

🔹Enabling cities to run smoother with autonomous maintenance systems.

🔹Creating entirely new forms of income and collaboration between humans and machines.

These aren’t theoretical use cases — they’re already being built today with peaq, in areas like energy, mobility, and logistics.  
In the past, infrastructure was something only large companies and governments could control. 

With peaq’s decentralized approach, the model is flipped: machines become accessible tools anyone can plug into

And the benefits don’t go to a few platforms — they flow directly to the people and communities who participate. 
 The implications are enormous. 

Machines can now co-own the services they provide, share the profits, and evolve over time with the help of AI. 
We’re heading into a future where economic activity isn’t limited to humans, and where the systems we rely on become smarter, fairer, and more resilient 

Because they’re built by all of us, for all of us.  

And at the heart of this transformation is a network designed for this exact moment — peaq: the digital soil in which the machine economy will grow.",Energy

-29% EXPORT CRASH IN JUST ONE WEEK! 🛑

Russia’s war economy is taking a direct hit as EU sanctions tighten the noose on Putin’s oil exports. 👇👇

1. Russian crude exports plummeted 29% in one week — one of the steepest drops since the Ukraine war began.

2. Key ports like Primorsk, Novorossiysk, and Ust-Luga saw volume collapse under pressure.

3. New EU sanctions crippled Russia’s shipping, insurance & financing infrastructure.

4. A growing number of tankers are refusing Russian cargoes outright. Russia is now stuck relying on a shrinking “shadow fleet” with nowhere to go.

5. Kozmino port (shipping to China/India) is maxed out and can’t cover losses elsewhere.

6. The Kremlin is running out of time, options, and cash to fund its war machine. Every lost barrel is a crack in Putin’s facade of power.

Home to Reliance Industries’ Jamnagar Refinery, the world’s largest oil refining complex.

Also hosts Nayara Energy (formerly Essar Oil) refinery.

Key Exports:

Petroleum products (diesel, aviation fuel, naphtha)

Lubricants and petrochemicals

✅ Over 90% of Jamnagar’s exports come from the petroleum and petrochemical sector.

🥈 2. Surat, Gujarat – ₹89,000 crore exports

👕 Major Export Contribution: Textiles and Diamonds

Why Surat is key:

Known as the Textile Capital of India and a global hub for diamond polishing.

Key Exports:

Synthetic textiles, sarees, dress materials

Polished diamonds and gems

Technical textiles and garments

✅ About 40–50% of India’s polished diamonds are exported from Surat. ✅ Textiles and fabric exports are another significant contributor.

2025-06-06 23:15:39+00:00,"<My personal thoughts on natural gas>

It's true that LNG feed gas has been weak recently due to short-term maintenance, but that doesn't matter and won't last long.

The key is the year-end LNG ramp up. US LNG exports, which have already been on the rise for several years, will once again significantly increase towards the end of the year.

During this injection season, traders are bound to have an upside bias and will need to build much more stocks than normal. 

This is because everyone is anticipating the structural demand drivers, leaving the market extremely vulnerable to winter weather variability.

We don't need 5-year avg stocks, we need more than that. Nevertheless we are starting the beginning of the cooling demand season with a pretty good weather model.

L48 production remains stagnant. As the US shale basins are being gasified, we are unlikely to see a dramatic decline in Permian associated gas production despite lower oil prices, but we are certain to see slower growth than consensus at the start of the year.

Even in the traditional gas producing plays (Appalachian, Haynesville), we are seeing pretty good discipline. This is a huge opportunity for commodity funds or traders. 

You can buy producer stocks like $AR and $EQT to gain underlying exposure, and then continue to pursue additional gains through upside-biased short-term derivatives trading whenever the opportunity presents itself through the winter of 25/26.

The only weakness of the natural gas bull thesis is that the bullish consensus is held by a majority of industry veterans, which is understandably uncomfortable when it seems so obvious.

But so far, the natural gas market has worked very well.

*I took advantage of the decline in early April to buy a lot of $AR common stock, and as I already mentioned, I'm doing some short-term buy trades on NG futures.

2025-06-08 13:30:47+00:00,"China’s Coal Calculus: Security vs. Sovereignt

1. Geopolitical Fuel Triggers

   - Taiwan and LNG Fears: China coal for several reasons:
     - 45% of its LNG (liquefied natural gas) imports pass through the Malacca Strait, which is patrolled by the U.S.
     - Coal is domestically abundant, with reserves totaling 137 billion tons.
   
   - Nuclear Limitations: Nuclear power contributes only 5% of China’s energy. It is too slow and expensive to significantly replace coal on a large scale before 2035.

2. The Storage Gap

   - China requires over 1,000 GWh of storage capacity for renewables to effectively replace coal, but currently, it has less than 50 GWh.
   - As a result, coal ""peakers"" are used to back up renewables during periods of low generation, which comes at a substantial cost—approximately 1.4 billion tons of CO₂ emissions per year.

3. Renewable Contradiction

   - China is a leader in renewable energy, adding 230 GW in 2023:
     - However, the grid cannot integrate all this renewable energy without coal balancing, which saw an additional 48 GW of coal capacity added in 2023.
   
   - Thus, coal is not replacing renewables; rather, it is facilitating their growth during a challenging transition.
   - For China, coal acts as a ""transition"" resource, providing vital energy sovereignty amid the looming threats of U.S. sanctions and the ongoing Taiwan conflict.",Energy

2025-06-09 10:09:40+00:00,"Nigeria's Cocoa Just Did What Oil Couldn't

Nigeria’s cocoa exports skyrocketed from N171 billion in 2023 to N2.71 trillion in 2024, a 1,486% jump, fueled by improved processing, mechanized farming, and value-added products.

This surge has revitalized agriculture, boosting forex earnings and creating jobs.

Stock Market Impact

FTN Cocoa Processors Plc, a major player, saw its stock climb from a 200-day average of N1.87 to N2.40, nearing its 52-week high of N2.75, with 1.72 million units traded at N4.18 billion.

Investors are increasingly drawn to agribusiness due to its strong growth potential.

Drivers of the Surge

Government Support: Export Expansion Grants and agro-processing loans enhance competitiveness.

Global Demand: High demand for quality cocoa products in Europe and Asia.

Investor Shift: Portfolios are pivoting to agriculture as a high-potential sector.

Naira Devaluation: Boosts profitability of cocoa exports, serving as a currency hedge.

Enhanced Processing: Upgraded facilities improve efficiency and minimize waste.

Outlook and Challenges

Nigeria could rise to a top global cocoa exporter, driving investment in agro-processing and logistics.

Challenges like infrastructure gaps and climate risks persist, but the sector’s outlook is robust.",Energy

2025-06-10 20:50:02+00:00,"UPDATE:

After the US refused to extend the oil licenses to American oil companies like @Chevron in Venezuela, the CCP has moved in, and Venezuela's oil exports held steady in May 2025, thanks to a surge in shipments to China, offsetting a drop in U.S.-authorized sales. 

The U.S. Treasury and State Department revoked licenses for @PDVSA partners in March, giving firms until May 27th of this year to wind down their transactions. This led to reduced deliveries to traditional U.S. and European markets, with PDVSA canceling some cargoes to Chevron amid payment uncertainties thanks to US Sanctions on Venezuela

However, China stepped in, just as I said they would if the licenses were not extended, and China is now importing 584,000 barrels per day (bpd) as of May, up from 521,000 bpd in April, becoming Venezuela's top oil destination. 

This shift highlights China's growing role in supporting Venezuela's oil industry amid tightened U.S. sanctions, and its total proof that the CCP is expanding their economic control over Latin America as China aggressively continues their Belt and Road Initiative. 

Why on Earth would we want China to have control over the world’s largest oil reserves and more power in the Western Hemisphere? Hopefully changes are made soon. This is America Last energy policy. 

Sanctions aren’t even harming Venezuela because the CCP is offsetting US oil losses for Venezuela as China grows more powerful. 

The oil licenses need to be extended again. We can’t allow for China to win the Energy war.

2025-06-13 17:52:43+00:00,"More people unsubscribed from our free newsletter than any other day following Wednesday's email.

I sent out a newsletter outlining how we use relative strength to get into winning trades before everyone else.

I used our trade on $CVX from late 2021 as a focal point: 

We bought the strongest sector, in stocks that were showing relative strength, in a market that was beginning to breakdown.

It just so happened that Russia invaded Ukraine in February and our energy stocks shot up in value.

We had no idea that was going to happen. And that was the point.

Someone else did. There was a reason why the market wasn't selling energy stocks. And we caught onto that and followed along and made a bunch of money.

Fast forward to last Friday: 

The same situation. Energy stocks were, out of no where, showing relative strength.

Crude oil was back up and over a key level that made us act and so we did.

We bought $XOM -- and today they're up big.

The news headlines get the praise, but the profits came from a position being opened last Friday. 1 week ago. With no prior knowledge of war.

It was relative strength; the second most important idea in our Profits Over Prophets Framework.

I got replies back from Wedneday night's email along the lines of: 

""How dare you make light of Ukraines situation"" or ""This is sick. Who cares about your profits?""

I have bad news, folks. 

If you're in the market as a speculator, you have two choices:

- Act on what the market is telling you to make as much money as you possibly can,
- Get mad at everyone else who does it instead.

I'd rather be the winner. It's that simple.

Relative strength matters. And it can make you a lot of money if you're willing to listen.

Western media screams: Global crisis! Oil shock!
But let’s be clear:
China won’t be the one panicking.

1/
🇮🇷 Iran exports over 1 million barrels per day-mostly to one country: China.
Despite U.S. sanctions, China has remained Iran’s largest and most stable buyer, using gray shipping routes, RMB payments, and discreet refiners.

You think Iran wants to cut off its only lifeline?

2/
A Hormuz blockade would hit Japan, South Korea, India, and Europe far harder than China.
These U.S. allies get 70–90% of their oil from the Gulf.
Their tankers are more vulnerable.
Their dependency is greater.
Their panic is louder.

3/
🇨🇳 China isn’t invincible, but it is prepared:
• Strategic oil reserves = 90+ days
• Russian crude via land and sea
• Pipeline diversification via Central Asia and CPEC
• Quiet maritime routes via Oman and Pakistan
• Domestic production and demand management

4/
Let’s not forget:
A Hormuz crisis would skyrocket oil prices.
Guess who benefits?
• 🇷🇺 Russia: higher margins, tighter markets
• 🇮🇷 Iran: black-market premiums
• 🇨🇳 China: already stockpiled, buys cheap when others sell in panic

Only the West bleeds.

5/
So when Tehran rattles the Hormuz card, it’s not aimed at Beijing.
It’s a warning to Washington, London, and Tokyo:
“Block our economy, and we’ll block your oil.”

China?
China is watching-calmly, strategically, and with options in hand.

6/
The irony?
The West pushed Iran into China’s arms.
And now, the West is terrified of what China might do next.

Who’s afraid of Hormuz?
Not the dragon.

All of these items, a few of which may indeed have supply disruptions, especially Oil if Iran is involved, can also be framed as POSITIONS for a debt based spending splurge and thereby Dollar/UST's devaluation.

That's why Soft commodities go up, and Gold especially so, neither of these are consumed, anymore so by war than in peace, and the nations involved aren't significant Cocoa or Coffee Beans 🫘 [Softs] suppliers.

The key driver for the trades below are mainly Fiat/Debt debasement trades primarily [outside of oil, war consumes a lot, Iran is a supplier].

When you add in that we are already in Fiat/Debt debasement times, the conflict is an accelerant and simultaneously a distraction ""masking agent"" to the fiat and debt debasement into collapse.

What this means is that the final reserve asset standing in Gold, has a twin turbo charged response given the dual effects of an already established financial crisis, now receiving a huge tail wind of  the 'war pigs', doing their final surge of asset stripping and fiat debasement, that only arms dealers, politicians and other hyaenas  can do for their own personal enrichment at others cost.

All this makes the precious metals bull more extreme and really just getting started.

Initially, normally debt markets may get a minor fear bid, no meaningful evidence thereto given their dire state. Long run rates and inflation go up, this heat has been created also to counter complete consumer weakness.

2025-06-15 14:25:24+00:00,"What are alternatives if Iran closes the straits of Harmouz, Grok?

If Iran were to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical chokepoint for roughly 20-30% of global oil trade, the primary alternative for oil and gas exports from the Persian Gulf would be limited-capacity pipelines bypassing the strait. Here’s an overview of the main alternatives and their challenges:
1. Existing Pipelines
Saudi Arabia’s Petroline (East-West Pipeline):
Capacity: Approximately 5 million barrels per day (bpd).
Route: Connects oil fields in eastern Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea port of Yanbu, bypassing the Strait of Hormuz.
Status: Has spare capacity of about 2 million bpd, but this is insufficient to cover the 17-20 million bpd typically transiting the strait.📷
Challenges: Limited spare capacity, vulnerability to regional instability (e.g., Houthi attacks in the Red Sea), and the need for upgrades to handle significantly increased volumes.
Abu Dhabi’s Crude Oil Pipeline:
Capacity: Around 1.5 million bpd.
Route: Transports oil from Abu Dhabi’s oil fields to the port of Fujairah on the Gulf of Oman, bypassing the strait.
Status: Can handle roughly 75% of the UAE’s crude output, but this is a fraction of the region’s total exports.📷
Challenges: Limited capacity and inability to compensate for other Gulf producers like Iraq or Kuwait.

Iraq’s Pipelines:
Capacity: The Iraq-Turkey Pipeline (partially operational) and southern export terminals like Basra have limited bypass potential.
Challenges: Many pipelines are outdated, under repair, or disrupted by geopolitical issues. Iraq relies heavily on the strait for exports.📷

Iran’s Jask Terminal:
Capacity: Limited, designed to handle some of Iran’s own exports.
Route: Located in the Gulf of Oman, bypassing the strait.
Status: Operational since 2021 but primarily serves Iran’s needs, not other Gulf producers.📷
Challenges: Iran’s own exports would be curtailed by a strait closure, and it’s unlikely to share capacity with rivals.

2. Unused or Underutilized Pipelines

Spare Capacity: The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates about 2.6 million bpd of unused pipeline capacity from Saudi Arabia and the UAE combined.📷
Challenges: This is far below the volume needed to replace strait exports. Many pipelines are old, require maintenance, or face political and security risks (e.g., in Yemen or Syria).

3. Non-Pipeline Alternatives

Overland Transport: Trucking oil or gas is impractical due to the massive volumes involved, high costs, and logistical complexities across conflict-prone regions.

Alternative Sea Routes: There are no viable maritime routes to bypass the Strait of Hormuz, as it’s the only sea passage from the Persian Gulf to the open ocean.📷

Increased Production Elsewhere: Countries like the U.S., Russia, or Canada could ramp up production, but this would take months and wouldn’t fully offset the immediate loss of Gulf oil. The U.S., now a major exporter, could mitigate some impact for Western markets.📷
Strategic Reserves: Nations like the U.S., China, and members of the International Energy Agency could release strategic petroleum reserves to stabilize markets temporarily, but this is a short-term fix.

4. Economic and Geopolitical Considerations

Impact on Global Markets: A closure would likely spike oil prices by 50% or more, potentially pushing prices above $100 per barrel, causing economic disruption worldwide.📷📷
Iran’s Own Losses: Closing the strait would cut Iran’s oil exports (1.65 million bpd in 2024), which account for 65% of its government revenue, risking domestic instability.📷📷

Military Response: The U.S. Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, and allied navies could reopen the strait through minesweeping, escorts, or airstrikes, though this risks escalation.📷📷

China and India: As major importers of Gulf oil, they would pressure Iran to avoid closure, as it would harm their economies more than Western nations.📷📷

5. Practicality of Closure

Iran has the capability to disrupt the strait using mines, anti-ship missiles, drones, or fast boats, but a sustained closure is unlikely due to international backlash and self-inflicted economic damage.📷📷
Historical precedent (e.g., the 1980s Tanker War) shows Iran has disrupted shipping but never fully closed the strait.📷

Conclusion

The primary alternatives—Saudi and UAE pipelines—offer limited capacity, covering only a fraction of the 17-20 million bpd transiting the strait. Global oil markets would face severe disruption, with no immediate substitute for Gulf exports. Mitigation would rely on strategic reserves, increased non-Gulf production, and military efforts to reopen the strait, but these are short-term or high-risk options. Iran’s own economic dependence on the strait makes a prolonged closure improbable.

🔹 Trade truce - low tariffs - a reversal of the current US tariff policy, with trade barriers quickly returning to 2024 levels.
🔹 Trade tensions - 10% tariffs - global tariff barriers increase, but an all-out trade war is avoided.
🔹 Trade war - 30%-plus tariffs - US implements the tariffs announced on 2 April in full, with trading partners retaliating.

The rial, Iran’s currency since 1932, was valued at 70 to 1 USD and backed by oil wealth, global trade, and free markets before the 1979 Islamic invasion replaced the great Persian state with the Islamic regime.

Revisiting a National Call for Accountability: From Hon. EJ Agbonayinma to Senator Ned Nwoko @Prince_NedNwoko

 _News Nigeria, 17th June, 2025_ 

In 2017, Hon. EJ Agbonayinma, a member of the 8th Assembly in the Green Chambers (House of Representatives), moved a groundbreaking motion on the urgent need to investigate over 17 billion dollars worth of undeclared crude oil exports to global destinations from 2011 to 2014

The motion revealed that millions of barrels of Nigerian crude oil had been illicitly lifted and exported to various countries without due process or accountability.",Energy
2025-06-17 20:56:25+00:00,"‼️‼️‼️According to The New York Times, if the U.S. joins the strikes on Iran, Tehran is expected to begin mining the critically important Strait of Hormuz.

It appears that Iran plans to block the strait in this way, through which 20% of the world's oil trade passes — including oil from the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Iraq, which all rely on the Strait of Hormuz for market access.

At least in the short term, this would significantly increase fuel prices, which would benefit the Russian economy.

Stabilization of prices could occur if Saudi Arabia or another major oil producer sharply increases output, or if the conflict in Iran ends quickly enough for the crisis in the strait to be brief, allowing tanker traffic to resume without long-term disruption.",Energy

This move follows a 2022 ban on exports of lithium ore (the raw mined material), part of a broader crusade to benefit Zimbabwe’s economy and a trend amongst mineral-rich African states aiming to move beyond raw material exports. 

For example, Namibia halted exports of unprocessed lithium and rare earths in 2023 to drive domestic processing. In 2021, the Democratic Republic of the Congo tightened controls on cobalt and copper concentrates to encourage in-country refining. However, probably the most famous examples include those of the Alliance of Sahel States, comprising Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. These three countries ousted Western-aligned leaders in recent years and have embarked on a decolonisation process that includes reclaiming natural resources from foreign hands.

Returning to Zimbabwe, the country boasts Africa's largest lithium reserves and is among the world's top lithium producers. 

Back in 2023, Zimbabwean Mines Minister Winston Chitando said that Zimbabwe needed to ‘move up the value chain.’ The government had required producers to submit plans by March 2024 for local processing.

2025-06-20 20:56:42+00:00,"🦔 China's rare earth magnet exports crashed in May, showing how trade disputes can disrupt critical supply chains.
China controls 90% of global rare earth magnet production. These materials are essential for electric vehicles, wind turbines, and electronics.

May impact:
• U.S. imports fell 92% vs last year
• Global exports dropped 76%
• U.S. got just 46 tons vs 400+ tons in March
• Vietnam and Germany saw smaller declines

China imposed export controls in April during trade tensions but was selective about which countries got cut off. The U.S. bore the brunt while other nations continued receiving supplies.

Trump claims the issue was ""resolved"" after June meetings, but May's data shows significant damage to U.S. manufacturers who depend on these materials.

This episode highlights why companies are now prioritizing supply chain diversification. When one country controls 90% of a critical material, trade disputes can quickly shut down production lines.

It's a clear example of how trade policy directly impacts real manufacturing and forces businesses to rethink their sourcing strategies.

⭕ Rates have been reduced from the previous top rate of LKR 27.06/kWh.

📊 New Rates (per kWh)

▫️ 0–5 kW: LKR 20.90
▫️ 5–20 kW: LKR 19.61
▫️ 20–100 kW: LKR 17.46
▫️ 100–500 kW: LKR 15.49
▫️ 500 kW–1 MW: LKR 15.07
▫️ 1 MW+: LKR 14.46

⭕ Applies to new rooftop Solar PV systems for clearance requests submitted after June 16, 2025.

⭕ Tariff is locked in for 20 years once the agreement is signed.

⭕ From a solar-industry perspective, the newly reduced rates will be seen as detrimental to the industry, potentially discouraging investment and slowing the growth of renewable energy projects.

⭕ The reality is that the current solar tariff structure is based only on capital and investment costs, while actual average daytime generation costs are not factored in. This results in tariffs that remain well above the real cost of generating daytime power, undermining efforts to reduce overall electricity costs. If affordability is the government’s goal, solar tariffs should be set below the estimated 20-year average daytime generation cost.

⭕ Unlike in the past, Sri Lanka’s grid today has less need for intermittent sources like rooftop solar. Without integrated storage, solar creates imbalances and burdens the grid. The government should shift focus and promote battery-backed solar systems, which support grid stability and reduce reliance on fossil fuels during peak hours.

The Fed’s latest dot plot shows both inflation and unemployment moving up, even with good news on AI and oil.

Why? It’s the tariffs.

We’re imposing a supply shock on ourselves, making the Fed’s job harder.

It’s rare to see the Fed revise both inflation and unemployment higher at the same time, and even rarer when it’s driven by policy, not outside shocks.

2025-06-21 16:10:29+00:00,"Tired of watching gas fees eat your money?

We’ve all been there.

You try to swap a token… and the trade looks fair.
But then the gas hits.
$5, $10… sometimes even $30 just to make a swap.

That’s not trading, That’s leaking.

The problem with gas fees:

➢ Small trades don’t make sense anymore
➢ You have to time swaps around “low gas hours
➢ You keep losing money, before the trade even starts
➢ Most users don’t realize how much they’re actually losing

@1inch looked at that pain, and built a solution.
It’s called Fusion Mode.

What’s Fusion Mode?

Fusion Mode is a feature on 1inch that lets you swap tokens with zero gas fee.
Like… completely free from gas.

Not a discount, Not a refund later, Zero upfront fee.

You swap, and your wallet balance doesn’t get touched by gas.

So how does it work?

Behind the scenes, Fusion works through a new system:

✅ Instead of doing the swap yourself and paying gas…

1inch broadcasts your swap to professional fillers called Resolvers.
These are big players > market makers, bots, or institutions.

They pick up your trade, fill it on your behalf, and pay the gas themselves.

In return, they earn a small reward.
But it never comes out of your token amount. You still get what you wanted in full value.

That’s the win win
You save money, they get paid for helping you

What do YOU need to do?
➢ Stake some $1INCH token.
(This shows you’re an active user and unlocks Fusion Mode.)
➢ Choose “Fusion” when making a swap on the app or web interface.
➢ Done.
You don’t pay gas.
The resolver handles everything.

There’s no extra app. No side settings.
It’s baked into 1inch already.

Real example 👇

Let’s say you want to swap:

→ $150 worth of ETH to USDC
On a normal DEX, you might pay $8 gas on Ethereum.
That’s 5% of your whole swap… just gone.

Now imagine the same trade on Fusion Mode.

→ You pay $0 gas.
→ You receive full USDC.
→ You didn’t lift a finger, or lose a penny.

Guess what? Fusion mode works in many chains 

So wherever you go in Web3, Fusion can go with you.

What are the real benefits?

➢ Gasless swaps 
➢ Save money on every trade
➢ Works across chains
➢ Trusted and audited smart contracts
➢ You keep full custody of your tokens
➢ Trades are executed by resolvers, not custodians
➢ No crazy setup > just stake & swap

Even if you’re a small trader, or just starting out,
this feature keeps you from bleeding out on fees.

And here’s why it’s smart👇

@1inch doesn’t force anything.
You can still choose Classic Mode if you want.

But if you’re tired of fees…
Fusion is sitting there waiting > like a gasless superpower.

You’re not giving up control.
You’re not trading with someone else’s wallet.
You’re not risking security.

Just a smarter way to swap.",Energy

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday called for China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, one of the most important trade routes for crude oil in the world.

""I encourage the Chinese government in Beijing to call them about that, because they heavily depend on the Straits of Hormuz for their oil,"" Rubio said in an interview on Fox News. China is Iran's most important oil customer and maintains friendly relations with the Islamic Republic.

Iran's foreign minister warned earlier Sunday that the Islamic Republic ""reserves all options to defend its sovereignty,"" after the U.S. bombed three key nuclear sites over the weekend.

Iranian state-owned media, meanwhile, reported that Iran's parliament backed closing the Strait of Hormuz, citing a senior lawmaker. However, the final decision to close the strait lies with Iran's national security council, according to the report.

An attempt to block the narrow waterway between Iran and Oman could have profound consequences for the global economy. Some 20 million barrels per day of crude oil, or 20% of global consumption, flowed through the strait in 2024, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Oil prices could shoot above $100 per barrel if the strait is closed for a prolonged period, according to Goldman Sachs and consulting firm Rapidan Energy. JPMorgan analysts view the risk of Iran closing Hormuz as low because the U.S. would view such a move as a declaration of war.

Rubio said it would be ""economic suicide"" for Iran to close the strait because the Islamic Republic's oil also passes through the waterway. Iran is the third-largest oil producer in OPEC, pumping 3.3 million barrels per day. It exports at least 1.6 million bpd, with nearly 80% sold to China, according to the EIA.

2025-06-22 23:04:35+00:00,"Closure of the Strait of Hormuz & the impact on the price of farm produce in Nigeria.

Surge in Oil and Fuel Prices: The Strait of Hormuz handles about 20% of global oil and 20% of LNG trade. A closure could push Brent crude oil prices to $120-$150 per barrel, or even $350 in extreme scenarios. Nigeria, despite being an oil producer, relies heavily on imported refined petroleum products due to limited domestic refining capacity. A spike in global oil prices would increase the cost of petrol and diesel, potentially reaching N2,000-N3,000 per litre in Nigeria.

Increased Agricultural Input Costs: Nigerian farmers depend on imported inputs like fertilizers, pesticides, and machinery fuel. The Middle East, via the Strait, supplies 16.3% of global seaborne fertilizer trade. A closure would disrupt these supplies, driving up prices.

Food Inflation and Supply Chain Disruptions: Higher fuel and input costs would translate to elevated food prices. Nigeria’s inflation rate, already high (around 32% in mid-2025), could worsen as transport and production costs due to our Nigeria’s import-dependent economy. Additionally, Nigeria imports agricultural commodities like wheat and sugar through global trade routes affected by higher shipping costs and insurance premiums, exacerbating food price hikes.

Currency Pressure and Economic Instability: Nigeria’s reliance on oil exports (over 80% of foreign exchange earnings) means a global price spike could temporarily boost revenue, but a Strait closure would disrupt trade logistics, weakening the naira due to higher import bills. A weaker naira would make imported inputs and food even more expensive, hitting consumers hard. Rural farmers, often operating on thin margins, would struggle to absorb these costs, potentially reducing output and tightening food supply.

Mitigating Factors: Nigeria has strategic petroleum reserves covering 9-10 days of consumption, which could buffer short-term disruptions. Diversified oil imports from Russia, the U.S., and West Africa (e.g., Nigeria’s 5% crude imports from Africa) could ease some pressure. However, these measures are insufficient for a prolonged closure, and global spare oil capacity (5.7 million bpd, mostly in Saudi Arabia and UAE) is largely Strait-dependent, limiting relief.

Estimated Impact: Based on historical precedents like the 1970s oil shocks, a sustained closure could double or triple transport and input costs, potentially increasing staple food prices (e.g., rice, yam, or tomatoes) by 30-50% within weeks. Poorer households, spending 60-70% of income on food, would face severe hardship 

Brace up dear farmers!
We hope for dialogue sooner than later. 

Summary:
Striat of Hormuz closure will affect oil movement, which will affect food price in Nigeria. Smallholder farmers will be poorer, food prices will go up, and urban dwellers will spend more on food.

⸻

For years, Web3 gaming came with trade-offs.
Clunky onboarding. Laggy gameplay. High gas fees.

We got used to thinking, “that’s just how it is.”
Most of us either accepted the compromises, or slowly walked away.

But then Sei came along, and quietly flipped that narrative.

⸻

On Sei, games run fully on-chain, and yeah, they actually feel good.

Try @hotspring_HQ and @archerhunter_HQ, which have topped the charts by onboarding real users from their original Web2 player bases.
Or jump into @dragonlandgg and @IdleGlory, where you can start playing instantly just by logging in with your social accounts.

Onboarding? Just a few taps.

With Sei Global Wallet, players sign in using Google, Twitter, or Telegram.
No extensions. No crypto background required. Just play.

⸻

How is this possible?

The reasons: 

⸻

1. Sei Giga.
Sei processes 5 gigagas per second (~200K TPS) with ~400ms finality, thanks to a multi-proposer consensus and parallel execution engine.

“Laggy environment”?
Error 404 on Sei.

2. A different mindset.
We’re not chasing speculation.
We’re helping games that want to retain users, build communities, and scale long-term.

‘Long-term’ is the keyword that we have been iterating. 

3. Full-stack support.
From infra to GTM, from creator partnerships to on/offline activations, we’re in the trenches with our partners, building together.

⸻

The results?
•600,000+ daily active wallets 
•#1 gaming chain by UAW over the past 30 days

* And most importantly: games people come back to play * 

⸻

This is what Web3 gaming was meant to look like.

- Trade & Aviation: Global trade saw short-lived disruption from oil price volatility and regional airspace closures, though broader markets and supply chains quickly regained stability.

- Strategic Outcome: Israel maintained a military edge, targeting Iran’s nuclear sites with precision. Yet, neither side achieved decisive strategic gains—leaving the conflict’s core issues unresolved.

“The largest single source of emissions is the nearly 1 billion miles that Californians drive each day. Accordingly the state has ordered that by 2035, all new cars sold must be zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs). However, the state has interim goals and, so far, purchases of electric vehicles are falling well short.
This year’s goal was to be 35%, but sales have been running about 10 percentage points behind, compelling the Air Resources Board to push the 2026 goal of 43% off until 2027.
Meanwhile the Republican-controlled Congress, in response to pleas from automakers, has passed and President Donald Trump has signed legislation to cancel the state’s authority to deviate from national emission standards, effectively halting the zero-emission mandate.”

They are now paying for Fire Suppression (about $1 Billion) out of taxes that CA companies pay for climate change (also called Cap & Trade).  We ultimately pay these taxes because they are passed on in higher gas prices, utilities and goods. 

It makes sense to pay for Fire Prevention out of this fund (removing brush, trees, dangerous fuels so that we don’t have catastrophic fires with huge emissions).  But they are only using $200 million to do that important work. 

Paying for Fire Supression (firefighter response) makes no sense because that is responding to catastrophic fires that have already started, not preventing them.  This has usually been a General Fund cost but that is now being moved over to Cap & Trade to balance the budget.  

It’s even more problematic because when they want to use that money for some new “green” project like High Speed Rail, the firefighter budget will get cut.

Iraq has boosted exports in recent years, including to the United States, as it hasn’t adhered to its supply quota under the OPEC+ agreements.
But in May, Iraq cut its crude oil production by 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 3.93 million bpd, compared to its target of 4.049 million bpd, according to the latest OPEC data from secondary sources.

Iraq is compensating for previous overproduction as it has been one of the main overproducers in the OPEC+ deal for years, alongside Kazakhstan and Russia, non-OPEC members of the OPEC+ pact. 

Iraq ranked first among the 12 OPEC producers in terms of exports to the United States in May. Shipments totaled nearly 7 million barrels of crude, 6.95 million barrels to be precise.

The second-largest OPEC supplier to the U.S. was Nigeria with 6.803 million barrels of crude oil exports, followed by Saudi Arabia with 6.208 million barrels of crude.

Last month, estimates put Iraq’s crude oil exports to the United States surging past 5 million barrels in May, marking Baghdad’s highest monthly volume to U.S. refiners so far this year.

The surge reflects sustained U.S. appetite for heavier Middle Eastern grades, with Iraqi crude averaging between 160,000 bpd and 190,000 bpd in May.

As OPEC+ maintains voluntary output curbs and U.S. shale growth moderates, Iraq has solidified its position among Washington’s top five crude suppliers.

2025-07-03 22:44:15+00:00,"FACT: Israel and Iran maintained significant covert trade in oil and weapons until the late 1980s, with activity declining but not disappearing entirely into the 1990s.
Oil Trade:
•From the mid-1950s until the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Iran was Israel’s primary oil supplier, providing over 90% of Israel’s oil imports at times. This relationship was highly secretive, with both sides concealing the extent of their cooperation due to regional sensitivities and Arab opposition.
•After the 1979 Revolution, official diplomatic relations ceased, but clandestine oil trade continued into the 1980s. Iranian oil was sold to Israel through covert channels and intermediaries, such as the Swiss trader Marc Rich, and transported via a secret pipeline.
•This covert oil trade persisted throughout the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988), with Israeli arms sales to Iran often being paid for in oil shipments. The arrangement reportedly continued sporadically and unofficially even after the war, though at a reduced scale.
Weapons Trade:
•During the Iran–Iraq War, Israel was a major supplier of arms to Iran, selling an estimated $500 million to $2 billion worth of weapons annually in the early 1980s. These included anti-tank guns, missiles, spare parts for aircraft, and other military equipment.
•Much of this arms trade was facilitated with the tacit approval of the United States, particularly as part of efforts to prevent an Iraqi victory and later as part of the Iran–Contra Affair (1985–1986).
•Arms sales continued after the Iran–Iraq War, but became more sporadic and unofficial, with some reports of Israeli arms deals with Iran into the early 1990s",Energy

The Fed, slow to act, cuts rates to counter falling prices, but tech efficiency and global U.S. Stablecoin adoption ensure deflation. Automation job losses are offset by re-skilling, income support, stabilizing demand. Regional gold-Bitcoin currencies promote global cooperation, reinforcing deflation, with Bitcoin as a key reserve asset.",Energy

2025-07-06 10:24:43+00:00,"Symphony: A World Where I Don’t Have to Trade Anymore

If you’ve ever spent your day thinking:

“Should I do this on Ethereum or Solana…?”
“Why is gas so high again?”
“Why am I still doing this manually…?”

Then let me introduce you to @symphonyio —the protocol that says: “Don’t trade harder. Trade smarter. Actually, don’t trade at all. Let your agents do it.”

Symphony is not just another protocol.
It’s an Agentic Financial Layer—a new financial operating system where agents trade, think, and coordinate for you.

And these aren’t your average bots.
Symphony agents make decisions, execute strategies, manage risks—and most importantly, they do it together. Welcome to agent collaboration:

one agent handles strategy, another handles execution, another handles risk.
Basically, you now have a trading team that doesn’t sleep, panic, or check Twitter for price action.

Best part? These agents are chain-agnostic.
They don’t care which blockchain you’re on.
Ethereum? Solana? Arbitrum? Bitcoin L2?

To them, it’s all just one big playground.

And because they’re not limited by chain boundaries, they can execute across all of them.
That’s cross-chain execution in action.

Your trade might source liquidity on Solana, hedge on Arbitrum, and settle on Bitcoin L2—all automatically, all in sync.

It’s like giving your agents a passport and telling them,
“Go make me money—wherever it is.”

But what about scalability?

That’s where trade sharding comes in.
Instead of queuing all transactions through one chokepoint, Symphony shards them across chains, agents, and strategies.
More throughput. More speed. Less gas. More alpha.

The result?
Trades that are faster, smarter, and infinitely scalable.

Of course, someone needs to coordinate all this madness. That’s the job of the Orchestrator—Symphony’s real-time control tower.

It tells each agent what to do, when to act, and how to adapt to market conditions. It prevents conflicts, reroutes failing strategies, and keeps your whole agent team moving like a synchronized orchestra.
(And yes, it’s probably a better manager than your boss.)

So no, Symphony is not just another trading app.
It’s not a dashboard.
It’s not a bot.

It’s a living, breathing system:
- Built on a chain-agnostic foundation
- Capable of cross-chain execution
- Scaling with trade sharding
- Managed by a real-time orchestrator
- Powered by intelligent agent collaboration
→ All together forming the Agentic Financial Layer.

You no longer need to click buttons, sign transactions, or stress over bridges. Symphony thinks, plans, and acts for you.

So next time the market goes crazy…
Feel free to sip your coffee.

Symphony’s already on it.",Energy

Hello friends!
Today, I want to talk about a new project I really like: @vooi_io 

VOOI is a special DeFi platform. You can trade crypto from different blockchains easily. You don’t need to use bridges or pay high gas fees.

Here are some simple things to know:

🔁 Easy Trading Between Blockchains
VOOI supports many blockchains (EVM and non-EVM). You can trade on different chains with one wallet. Very easy!

🛠️ Simple and Safe
The platform is like a centralized exchange (CEX), but it is decentralized. You keep your crypto safe and control your own wallet.

💸 Low Gas Fees and Rewards
VOOI helps you save money. It gives gas fee discounts and rebates (money back) when you trade on some DEXs like Orderly.

🎯 Learn and Earn
VOOI has a small app on Telegram. You can learn and also have fun. It is good for new users.

🤝 Invite Friends and Earn Together
You can invite your friends to VOOI. If they trade, you earn a small reward too.

🚀 Big Support
Big names like Binance Labs and Consensys support VOOI. This is a strong project.

I think VOOI is not just a platform it is a new way to use DeFi.

Did you know about VOOI before? What do you think?

CFD Trading Made Simple

CFDs (Contracts for Difference) sound fancy, but they're straightforward. You're making a bet on price direction. If you think gold prices will go up, you go ""long."" If you think they'll drop, you go ""short."" You win when you're right, lose when you're wrong.

The magic happens with leverage. With just $100 and 10x leverage, you can control a $1,000 position. When gold moves 1% in your favor, you make $10 instead of $1.

Getting Started Takes 30 Minutes

Register on prices surge during conflicts, while gold rises amid, verify your identity, and deposit $100. Pick gold or oil from the CFD section. Choose your direction - up or down. Start with 5x leverage and set a stop-loss. Done.

Trade Smart

Risk only $1-2 per trade when starting with $100. Use Bybit's charts to spot trends. Watch the news - oil jumps during conflicts, gold rises with inflation fears.

Quick Example

Oil at $75. You deposit $100, use 10x leverage, and bet it goes up. Set stop-loss at $74.50, and take-profit at $76.50. Oil hits $76? You make $130. Drops to stop-loss? You lose $50.

Avoid These Traps

Skip 500x leverage - it'll wipe you out fast. Always use stop-losses. Stay updated on market news.

U.S. President Donald Trump is seriously weighing the introduction of tough secondary sanctions against countries that continue to trade oil with Russia — including China, India, and Turkey. The plan involves supporting a bill that would impose a 500% tariff on imports from Russia, effectively amounting to a global oil embargo.

According to The Times, this shift in Trump’s stance is driven by his growing frustration with Vladimir Putin’s refusal to engage in peace talks and continued strikes on civilian targets in Ukraine. Trump had previously called the bill “too harsh,” but now says he is “studying it carefully.”

The outlet notes that the key concern is the risk of economic fallout. The White House wants to ensure that the power to lift sanctions remains with the president, while Congress is pushing for more oversight. Analysts believe that even partial implementation of the measures could significantly damage the Russian economy.",Energy

2025-07-11 22:57:03+00:00,"🚨 Rumors swirl that @POTUS may be preparing a massive move to end Putin’s war by tanking Russia’s oil revenues — maybe as soon as Monday.

Could he do it? He’s the one person on Earth who might actually pull it off.

🧵Here’s how:

1. The idea? Crush Russia’s oil exports, which fund ~40% of the Kremlin’s budget. But there’s a twist: He hates high oil prices more than any president in history. If he goes through with this, it’s a game of chicken — between oil prices and economic war.

2. For context: Russia exports ~7 million barrels/day of oil & petroleum products (of which about 4.5mbpd crude; of that India buys about 1.7mbpd and China about 2.2mbpd). 

That’s too much for even OPEC to replace if such sanctions deter Indian & Chinese refiners perfectly for a while. 

Of course, oil markets are never perfect. Instead, oil always finds a way. Sellers and buyers meet — sanctions or not. 

But that is ONLY true over time. In the short term, sanctions force all actors to reconsider their positions and thus absolutely create a supply shock to the market if introduced on a tight timeline.

3. Today, India and China buy some 70% of Russian crude, mostly at a discount. This isn’t a loophole — it’s by design. Western sanctions aim to limit Russia’s income while keeping prices manageable for the West. That is also why the West (US & Europe) introduced the sanctions gradually over 12-15 months in 2022. It gave everyone the time to rearrange themselves. 

But Trump’s approach may flip that script. He could introduce a tariff shock with immediate effect to which oil prices will react because — for the very least — the shorts are forced to cover their positions. 

4. The proposed Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025 targets countries helping fund Russia’s war by continuing to import Russian energy.

It proposes a 500% tariff (!!) on imports by the United States from countries (like India & China) that buy Russian oil.

5. That’s a big stick. And Trump could wield it effectively — if he’s willing to stomach the oil price shock that might follow for a limited period.

6. The bill also includes an escape hatch, giving Trump max leverage to negotiate peace with the Kremlin: The president can issue a 180-day waiver to any country based on U.S. national security interests. 

A second waiver may be possible under certain conditions (per Hill reporting). This gives flexibility — and leverage.

⸻

Bottom line: If Trump backs this fully, it could mark the most aggressive energy sanctions in modern history. Big oil, geopolitics, tariffs, and a high-stakes showdown with Putin and oil markets — all in one.

All despite high refinery runs.  While OPEC+ boosts output to meet summer demand, Russia’s June production falls short of quota — something Moscow often exceeded despite pressure. Some saw this as Russia finally showing discipline. But now, it’s looking like structural strain. With weak export flows and rising domestic fuel demand, the IEA says Russia may struggle to maintain its upstream capacity.

2025-07-12 17:52:00+00:00,"If Defi Feels More Complicated, Then You need @vooi_io

Defi has a lot of problems.

Gas fees. Bridging. Switching networks. Managing multiple wallets.
All just to trade one asset.

But VOOI said: what if we killed all that?
And they did so with chain & account abstraction.

Here’s what that means for you:
⩙ Trade across EVM & non-EVM chains (yes, even Solana)
⩙ No gas needed — VOOI handles it behind the scenes
⩙ Unified balance across all chains — no juggling wallets
⩙ Just 1-click trades. Seamless. Mobile-first.

It feels like a CEX. Yes
But under the secret is that, It’s all DeFi.

Gasless. Chainless. Frictionless.

Here’s how it works 

➥ Chain Abstraction:
You don’t need to worry about which chain you're on.
VOOI abstracts away the underlying infrastructure, so whether it’s Ethereum, Arbitrum, or even non-EVM chains like Solana — it's all one tap from your end.

➥ Account Abstraction:
This lets you interact with DeFi without being locked to a specific wallet per chain.
Your balance is unified. One account, many chains.
Trade any market without hopping between wallets or switching RPCs.

➥ Gasless Trading:
VOOI handles gas behind the scenes using relayers.
You don’t pay gas fees — not even network-specific ones.
This is possible thanks to their use of gas abstraction tech and internal liquidity routing.

➥ Unified UX:
All this is delivered via a mobile-first interface that feels like a CEX, but keeps you fully non-custodial.
No seed phrase needed to sign up. No technical setup. Just trade.

No need for a separate bank account or even that clunky MetaTrader 5 software.

What’s cool about it?

✅All-in-one trading: Trade crypto and traditional assets in one place. Want to bet on Tesla stock or gold prices? Done.
✅No fiat needed: Just use USDT no bank transfers or currency conversions.
✅Leverage: Go wild with up to 500x leverage on gold (risky, though!) or 5x on stocks.
✅Copy Trading: Lazy? Copy pro traders automatically.
✅Low fees: Like 0.04 USDT per stock trade (with discounts sometimes).

What can you trade?
✅Stocks: FAANG companies (Apple, Tesla, etc.) as CFDs (you don’t own the actual stock).
✅Commodities: Oil, gold, etc.
✅ Forex & Indices: Major currency pairs and market indexes.

Perks & Limitation
Promos: They ran a 1M USDT prize pool for traders (free money alert 🚨).
Regional limits: Not available in Europe (EEA) due to regulations.

People are hyped about the convenience, but some are side-eyeing the risks (high leverage + security stuff).

2025-07-13 16:45:55+00:00,"Honestly, I think @vooi_io is exactly the kind of project that’s here to make our DeFi lives easier. Normally if you want to trade perps, you have to hop chains, pay gas everywhere, manage different balances, jump across a bunch of DEXs… it’s a headache. VOOI pretty much solves this by saying “single balance, multi-chain, no gas fees”.

The Light version is super user-friendly — perfect for regular users or anyone just getting into DeFi. No worrying about gas fees, you don’t even care what chain you’re on, the interface does it all for you. Honestly, that’s pretty damn convenient.

But if you’re a bit obsessive like me — needing stops, limits, share orders, alertatron bot setups — then the Pro version is your playground. API + automation is the real treat here. You can build a fully systemized strategy without letting emotions screw you over. (Because let’s be real, emotions wreck traders 😄)

The AI Copilot part is also interesting. Of course, there’s a lot of “AI” hype BS in crypto, so we’ll see if VOOI actually delivers something that gives us an edge. But still, live token votes, strategy suggestions… it adds a fun layer to trading.
Their fee structure is decent too. Plus they’ve got a referral setup where you can earn up to 25% rebates. So if you’re scaling up, you can literally make some extra passive yield off that alone.

Overall, I kinda see VOOI as the Binance of DeFi. Same simplicity, but decentralized, multi-chain, no gas fees, with AI and bots on top… what else could you want? 😄

Of course, it’s still kinda early — basically still in beta. But their roadmap looks solid. Once they roll out that Ultra version they’re planning, you might never want to trade manually again.
If I were you, I’d try some small trades, mess around with the bot setup, and explore Pro. You don’t have to worry about wallet juggling or paying gas everywhere — it’s all single balance, gasless. It’s basically almost free to experiment.

Long story short: huge potential here. Easy for newbies, powerful for pros. Definitely worth keeping an eye on bro.",Energy

#Sudan’s war:  an economic shockwave shaking the entire region 

A new report by The East African @The_EastAfrican highlights the growing economic toll of the Sudan conflict on neighboring countries. The war has disrupted trade, transport, oil routes, and markets across East and Central Africa.

Here’s what’s happening:

1️⃣ Kenya: Sudanese trade through Mombasa is declining, affecting Kenyan exporters and transport corridors.

2️⃣ Uganda: Cross-border trucking and trade into Sudan have collapsed.

3️⃣ Ethiopia : Lost access to a key regional export market and suspended several land routes.

4️⃣ South Sudan: Crippled by the halt in oil exports via Sudanese pipelines.

5️⃣ Chad & Eritrea : Suffering from shrinking border markets and rising instability due to spillover from the war.",Energy

Good morning from Australia.

In geopolitics, President Trump agreed to send Ukraine not just defensive Patriot missiles but possibly offensive ones that can even strike Moscow - and paid for by the EU/NATO;

Trump also threatened Russia with severe oil tariffs, including secondary, in 50 days if it doesn’t change track…. oil tumbled, which hurts Russia;

‘Italy and Greece sound the alarm over Libya. But allies aren’t rushing to help.’ (Politico) as “Rome and Athens have identified Turkish and Russian involvement in a growing security threat from North Africa.” Problems everywhere for the EU and no willingness or ability to focus on all of them; as

Macron said “To be free, you must be feared.” Except nobody is afraid of Europe;

In geoeconomics, Brazil asked the U.S. to reduce its tariff from 50% to 30%. Yes, that’s seen as a win now;

‘EU warns of ‘big gap’ in trade talks after Trump’s 30% tariff threat’ (FT) as “Bloc’s trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič said duties at that level would make transatlantic trading ‘almost impossible’” So 30% isn’t a win for Europe;

Mexico's President Sheinbaum said there has been progress with the U.S. on security issues to remove 30% tariffs - an agreement has almost been finalised and doesn’t have US troops stationed there. Again, Fortress North America; and

The NYT runs a detailed article warning of a new China trade shock that’s looming as data show its exports keep going up and imports don’t; 

In politics, French PM Bayrou faces a ‘moment of truth’ today and may lose his job, and Macron another government, if he can’t find €40bn in budget adjustments for 2026 just as defence spending goes up;

The Supreme Court gave Trump the green light to fire Education Department workers, another key legal win for him;

In markets, Nvidia is trying to sell “sovereign” AI(s), says The Economist - as in he who decides the exception?; and

xAI signed its first contract with the Pentagon; and

Some wonder if Bessent could wear two hats at Treasury *and* the FOMC? Totally logical in terms of economic statecraft; totally insane in terms of economic policy;

Long bond yields rise all over as markets realise it’s now fiscal and not monetary policy in the drivers’ seat, “heading for inflationville”; and

@aeberman12 conversely explains how statecraft now sets oil prices, not markets, for those who think otherwise.",Energy

From the onset, it was extractive. No surprise there; we don’t have much to export to the U.S. except oil and other raw materials.

Any trade deal that doesn’t include serious investment in infrastructure, production capacity, and technology transfer is not a good deal for Africa. You can’t export what you don’t produce. So no, Africa didn’t fumble AGOA, it simply wasn’t built for our industrial development. It was built to serve U.S. strategic interests.

And let’s not ignore the ridiculous conditions. One of them? That participating countries must never undermine U.S. national security. What does that even mean? It’s vague, political, and imperial. AGOA wasn’t just about trade, it was a soft-power tool to secure African allegiance and push back against rising competitors like China.

If the U.S. wants to be taken seriously as a partner, it needs to restructure AGOA to reflect real partnership, where African nations gain the tools to produce, compete, and grow sustainably. Until then, let’s stop pretending we fumbled anything.",Energy

2025-07-18 15:47:41+00:00,"‼️ On July 18, 2025, the EU agreed on the 18th sanctions package against Russia, which provides for further restrictions on energy trade.

The price of Russian oil is now strictly limited to $47.6 per barrel – approximately 15% below the average market price over the last three months. The sanctions package also includes a ban on transactions related to the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines, meaning that Russia's plans to ""rescue"" this infrastructure through the US are now futile.

Russia's hopes of blocking the adoption of the new package with the help of Hungary and Slovakia also did not materialize. Slovakia received a guarantee of protection against gas supply disruptions until 2028 and supported the EU's joint decision.

Against this backdrop, India announced its readiness to replace Russian oil with Middle Eastern oil. On July 17, Indian Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri confirmed that Delhi was ready to switch from Russia to other sources (Brazil, Canada, Guyana, the Middle East). The number of countries supplying oil to India has increased from 27 to 40 over the past month, confirming India's readiness to adapt quickly.

‼️ How this will affect Russia's economy:

◾️ In the coming months, budget-generating oil and gas revenues should fall sharply (a reduction of at least 30–40% is forecast). Inflation will accelerate, and the ruble will weaken;
◾️ The room for circumventing sanctions is narrowing;
◾️ If India switches to alternative suppliers, this will deprive Russia of a market share that is extremely important to it;
◾️ The introduction of sanctions on Nord Stream operations ""shuts down"" potential loopholes and Moscow's ""investment maneuvers"" to return to the European market.

The Kremlin understands the severity of the economic consequences of continuing the war, but is not seeking a political solution. Russia understands that the US is also considering the possibility of imposing new sanctions, but there are currently no signs that Putin is ready for de-escalation and genuine peace talks.

Negotiations and the positions of the parties involved - the EU, the US, and China - are important factors that will determine how the situation develops and whether further sanctions will be imposed.",Energy

Most DeFi platforms make you trade like you’re stuck in 2019.

They silo liquidity.
They force you to bridge.
They give you leverage with no control.
And you’re still paying gas on every move.

@vooi_io is replacing the framework 

At its core, VOOI is a perpetual aggregator that supports both EVM and non EVM chains.

It gives traders access to deeper markets without touching a bridge or switching wallets.

Everything runs through a chain abstracted layer with account abstraction baked in.

That means:
– Gasless execution
– Unified position management
– Zero fragmentation
– Real self-custody

The trade flow is clean, the data path is transparent, and the infra is built for scale.

VOOI’s mission?
To make leveraged trading feel like a product of this decade not a patchwork of tools and risk.

2025-07-19 08:08:27+00:00,"🚨IQD RV: SALARY RESOLUTION IN ERBIL BAGHDAD “SIGNAL”

WASHINGTON DC - The United States said on Saturday that the resolution of Erbil-Baghdad tensions over oil exports and finances would signal that the Iraqi government is committed to creating a suitable environment for companies to invest in the country. 

“We have consistently encouraged Baghdad and Erbil to resolve their issues regarding salaries and the reopening of the ITP,” a State Department official told Rudaw in response to an email, referring to the Iraq-Turkey Pipeline. 

“Addressing these issues quickly would signal that Iraq puts the interests of its people first and is committed to creating an environment in which companies will want to invest. Establishing that business-friendly environment requires respecting contract sanctity and providing necessary security guarantees,” added the official.

Iraq’s Council of Ministers on Thursday approved a new financial agreement with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), paving the way for the resumption of salary payments to the Region’s public employees and the restart of Kurdish oil exports, which have been suspended for more than two years. 

The Iraqi government said the agreement stipulates that the KRG is obliged to export all of the oil produced from its fields - estimated at 230,000 barrels per day - through Iraq’s State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO). The KRG will retain 50,000 barrels per day for local consumption, covering production costs, while the federal Ministry of Oil may provide refined oil products equivalent to 15,000 barrels per day if needed. Erbil will also hand over non-oil revenues. In return, Baghdad will pay the Kurdish government’s share from the federal budget.

The KRG, which approved the deal with the federal government ahead of its announcement by Baghdad, has not confirmed its contents. Kurdish Prime Minister Masrour Barzani said he welcomed their “understanding” and expected Baghdad to resume the disbursement of the salaries of his government’s civil servants who have only been paid for four months this year. 

With the announcement of their agreement, drone attacks on locations in the Kurdistan Region have stopped. In the month of July, there were at least 18 drone attacks. Oil fields operated by international companies have been a primary target. The last incident occurred on Thursday when two explosive-laden drones crashed in the outskirts of Erbil, according to the Erbil-based Directorate General of Counter Terrorism (CTD). Another drone attack was repelled on the same day in the Shekhan district of Duhok province, home to oil fields operated by international companies, a security source told Rudaw at the time.  

The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) has blamed the attacks on Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), a charge Baghdad has denied.

Aziz Ahmad, deputy chief of staff to Prime Minister Barzani, said in a statement on Wednesday that the Region has lost nearly 200,000 barrels of oil production due to the “spate of drone attacks by criminal militias on the Iraqi government payroll.”

The attacks have been widely condemned, including by the UN, US and UK. 

“Demonstrating a commitment to safeguarding and supporting international investment is especially important in the current environment where drone attacks have targeted U.S. and other international companies’ operations in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region without consequence,” the State Department official noted in the email to Rudaw.",Energy

💥 PM Barzani and Amb. Steven Fagin agreed on the urgent need for salary payments from Baghdad, the resumption of oil exports, and an end to drone attacks. They also called for a new KRG government to be formed before Iraqi elections.

ERBIL (Kurdistan24) – Prime Minister Masrour Barzani and the top U.S. diplomat in Iraq on Saturday presented a united front on the Kurdistan Region's most critical challenges, agreeing on the urgent need for Baghdad to release salary payments, for northern oil exports to resume, and for an end to drone attacks on energy infrastructure.

In a high-level meeting in the Kurdistan Region on Saturday, July 19, Prime Minister Barzani hosted Steven Fagin, the Chargé d'Affaires of the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. The meeting, also attended by U.S. Consul General Steve Bitner, covered the general situation in Iraq and the strengthening of bilateral relations.

According to a readout of the meeting, both sides came to a clear consensus on several pressing issues. They agreed that the federal government ""must send the Kurdistan Region's salaries and financial entitlements as soon as possible,"" and that the export of the Region's oil through the Turkish port of Ceyhan ""should resume in the near future.""

They also jointly stressed that the ""terrorist and destructive drone attacks on the Region's oil fields and energy infrastructure must stop.""

On the political front, both sides agreed that a new cabinet for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) ""must be formed before the Iraqi parliamentary elections,"" adding a timeline to the long-delayed internal political process.

During the discussion, Ambassador Fagin reaffirmed Washington's support for the federal entity and for a ""strong Kurdistan Region."" In turn, the Prime Minister thanked the United States for its ""continuous support.""

The points of agreement in the meeting touch on the core economic and security crises facing the Kurdistan Region.

The salary dispute has been a long-standing source of friction with Baghdad, leading to months-long delays in paying hundreds of thousands of public sector employees and causing significant economic hardship. The issue is tied to broader disagreements over budget allocations and revenue management.

The call to resume oil exports addresses the halt in pipeline flows since March 2023, following an international arbitration court ruling in favor of Baghdad. This shutdown has deprived the KRG of its primary revenue source.

Furthermore, the demand for an end to drone attacks highlights a persistent security threat. The Kurdistan Region's energy infrastructure has been repeatedly targeted by drone and rocket strikes widely attributed to Iran-backed militias, in what is seen as an effort to destabilize the region's energy sector.",Energy

Instead of justice, his lifeless body was taken away by the same forces and his family wasn’t even allowed to mourn him properly.

Locals begun a peaceful sit-in. Their demands are clear: hold the killers accountable, return the body to the family, and end this cycle of impunity.

Shah Dar’s killing is not a single incident, it is part of a disturbing pattern, where civilians have constantly been killed by both Pakistani and Iranian forces along the border.

For the people of Balochistan, especially those living near borders, trading oil is not a choice, it’s the last resort for survival amid crippling unemployment, inflation, and state neglect. Even that is being taken away through bullets and brutality.

📌CFD vs Tokenized Equities: Two Paths to Onchain Stocks

Let's have it in mind that not all onchain equities are created equal.

🪷There are two major models emerging:

1. CFDs (Contracts for Difference)  used by Bybit

2. Fully-backed Tokenized Equities e.g. xStocks via Backed Finance

Here’s the difference:

CFDs, used by @Bybit_Official, offer synthetic price exposure.

 You don’t own the asset, you’re just trading on its price movement

 There’s no underlying security being held, and no dividends, but the benefits are speed, leverage, and 24/7 access. 

📍CFD is designed for traders who want fast, flexible exposure to TradFi markets like stocks, oil, forex, and indices.

In contrast...

 @xStocksFi are 1:1 backed by real-world equities held in custody by regulated institutions. 

You actually own a token that represents a share of a real stock.

 If the underlying pays a dividend, it’s distributed to token holders via rebasing, your token balance increases to reflect dividend earnings.

 These tokens are composable, transferable, and usable as collateral in DeFi (like on @KaminoFinance).

🪷 So why both?

✔️ Bybit’s CFDs offer speed + scale for traders

✔️ xStocks offer composable, yield-bearing primitives for DeFi

Bybit’s strategic edge?

→ Wrap synthetic TradFi into crypto UX

→ Layer real incentives: $1M+ in bonuses, referral %, and content rewards

📍Bybit is one of the few platforms giving you access to both worlds, with rewards, bonuses, and even referral income on top.

“Tariffs are tools of political leverage — and this is revolutionary.”

He confirmed that Washington is preparing 100% secondary tariffs on countries that keep buying Russian oil if Putin refuses to make peace with Ukraine.

But the real message wasn’t for Beijing or New Delhi. It was for Brussels:

“Our European allies talk a big game — I’d urge them to follow us if we implement these tariffs.”

The Biden–Trump rivalry may be raging, but here’s one thing they seem to agree on:
💡 Oil pays for bombs. Cut the cash, stop the war.

Bessent also said the U.S. could push China to stop buying Russian and Iranian oil — as a bargaining chip in future trade talks.

2025-07-22 14:06:10+00:00,"Thread: xStocks Strategy 101 How to trade Tesla, Apple & more with just USDT.

No brokers. No banks. Just you and your wallet. 

Let’s go 🧵

1. 
What are xStocks?
They’re tokenized versions of real-world stocks.
I think you should know this if you've been following my threads.
- Tesla = xTSLA
- Apple = xAAPL
- Google = xGOOGL
Backed by real data, but tradable like crypto.

You don’t own the stock ,you trade its price. That’s freedom.

2. 
Why trade xStocks instead of real stocks?
 -No paperwork
- 24/7 trading (Wall Street closes, Bybit doesn’t)
- Use crypto as margin (USDT, ETH, etc.)
- Instant entry/exit
- Short or long,  your call

Wall Street doesn’t give you this much power, No shades but it's true.

3. 
The strategy:
🚀Trend riding
Use moving averages or RSI to ride momentum.
If xTSLA is breaking resistance, go long with stop-loss below support.

🚀Event sniping
Trade earnings season.
Apple’s about to report? Front-run the hype with a tight risk plan.

🚀 Hedge your bags
Short xNVDA if you think AI hype’s overcooked.
Use it to protect your crypto exposure when the market’s shaky.

4. 
Don’t ignore this:
- Always set stop-loss and take-profit
- Use isolated margin
- Avoid maxing out leverage
- Respect traditional market news,  these are stocks, not meme coins

5. 
Example setup:
🚀 xTSLA trade idea:
- Long at $250
- SL at $240
- TP at $275
-  5x leverage
You risk $10 to potentially gain $25, simple and clean.

6. TL;DR
xStocks = tokenized stocks you can trade like crypto
- Powered by @Bybit_Official
- Open 24/7
-  Trade global companies with just your wallet
-  Built for flexible, strategic moves, not guesswork.

Fresh memecoin launch, but no stress about listings, bridges, or gas. I can already view, chart, and trade it on @defloApp instantly.

If you’ve used CEXs before, you know the routine

- Wait for listing announcements
- Hope they list your token
- Get blocked by KYC
- Withdrawals delayed
- Funds are locked when you want to move fast

And by the time they finally list your token? The pump is done.

That’s why deflo is different.

- No waiting
- No begging for listings 
- No KYC walls

What are CFDs?

CFDs (Contracts for Difference) let you trade the price of a stock without owning the stock itself.
No dividends. No voting. No paperwork.
Just pure exposure, fast execution, and total control.

On Bybit with Xstocks you can trade 78+ U.S. equities including TSLA, AAPL, META, NVDA through 

MetaTrader 5 (MT5) with:
→ 5× leverage
→ USDT collateral
→ Instant market access

All without ever touching a bank or TradFi brokerage.

Why it matters:
- TradFi has rules. Fees. Settlement delays.
- Want to short Meta before earnings?
- You'll need margin approval, a business day, and a prayer.

On Bybit, it's just:
→ Click MT5
→ Fund with USDT
→ Long or short with leverage

You're not waiting. You're executing.
This is Wall Street-level trading without Wall Street-level gatekeeping.

But let’s be honest this isn’t for everyone.

CFDs are speculation tools.
You're not holding for retirement.
You're playing momentum, volatility, and direction.

⚠️ High risk
⚠️ High reward
⚠️ You’re here for precision, not dividends

If that fits your style, Bybit just gave you a high-performance machine.

TL;DR
→ Trade real stocks like AAPL & TSLA
→ Use USDT instead of fiat
→ 5× leverage
→ Instant execution via MT5
→ No broker, no delay, no TradFi nonsense

xStocksFi lets you trade tokenized stocks ->

They track real stock prices, in real time, using institutional-grade oracles like Chainlink and Pyth.

Here’s how to get started:

2. Navigate to Trade → xStocks
3. Choose any stock labeled with an ‘x’ (like $AAPLx or $TSLAx)
4. Trade instantly using USDT no fiat needed, no bank middlemen
5. Use familiar crypto tools: stop-loss, leverage, and even yield strategies via integrated partners

Why this matters:

Traditional stock markets are slow, expensive, and closed on weekends. You’re stuck in their system, playing by their hours. With xStocksFi, you break free.

You get:

•24/7 access to global equities (except weekends)

2025-07-24 21:19:16+00:00,"Here is what the anti zero lobbyists / Reform won’t  tell you. 

The percentage of the UK’s gas demand that will be met by imports by 2035 is projected to be around 75–85 %, based on current modelling.

Even if the UK fully exploits all remaining economically viable gas fields in the North Sea, it won’t make a major dent in import dependency by 2035. 

Under optimistic production scenarios, the UK would be able to meet at most ~20–25% of its gas demand from domestic production by 2035.

Even a best-case push to exploit remaining UK gas fields will not materially reduce the UK’s reliance on imports by 2035. The most effective strategies to cut import dependency are:

•Reducing demand (heat pumps, insulation, demand-side response).

•Electrification of heating and transport.

•Scaling up renewables and storage.

North Sea gas is no longer a path to energy security. It’s a declining resource with high extraction costs, limited volumes, and little effect on national demand. #NetZero #Climate #Energy #Renewables #HeatPump #EV #AirPollution #Health",Energy

This landmark project reflects Somaliland’s strategy of building real economic capacity in a region that remains heavily aid-dependent.

As Saeed Al Zari, Vice President of Government Affairs at DP World, stated:

“The future plans aim to improve the quality of edible oil, reducing the price of this essential commodity and now supplying both Ethiopia and Puntland.”

This development highlights the Somaliland government’s long-standing approach: trade, not aid. By investing in infrastructure and industrial growth, Somaliland is carving out a leadership role in regional supply and resilience.

Welcome to the world of tokenized stocks!

Tokenized stocks are digital assets that mirror the price of real-world stocks like Tesla or Meta.

They’re typically backed 1:1 by licensed custodians, meaning each token represents one actual share held in reserve.

The best part? You can trade fractional shares.
Can’t afford a full Tesla share? Just buy $10 worth.

You also get 24/7 access. No traditional brokerage account needed.

But you won’t get ownership rights, dividends, or voting power – just pure price exposure.

Still, it’s a powerful way for crypto-native traders to tap into traditional markets with fewer barriers.

Which stocks do you want to see tokenized next? 👇",Energy
2025-07-26 12:04:58+00:00,"Volkswagen profits collapse amid US tariffs and electric-vehicle disappointment | Carl Deconinck, Brussels Signal

Germany’s auto giant Volkswagen has reported a 36.3 per cent drop in its net profits, citing US tariffs and ongoing struggles with its electric vehicle strategy.

With weak performance across its premium brands, the Lower Saxony automaker also abandoned earlier hopes of up to 5 per cent revenue growth, now anticipating sales to remain flat compared to last year.

Weak financial results from Audi and Porsche, two of Volkswagen’s most profitable subsidiaries, also weighed heavily on group earnings.

“Increased US import tariffs and restructuring measures had a negative impact”, said chief financial officer Arno Antlitz.

Meanwhile, the shift to electric vehicles has dented Volkswagen’s economic engine considerably. “The operating result declined by a third year-on-year – also due to higher sales of lower-margin all-electric models,” Antlitz added.

Volkswagen’s second-quarter net profit fell to €2.29 billion, while its operating profit dropped by 29 per cent to €3.83 billion. Its operating margin of 4.7 per cent was now the lowest in years.

Revenue declined by 3 per cent to €80.6 billion despite a slight uptick in deliveries.

In response, Volkswagen cut its full-year profit margin forecast to between 4.0 per cent and 5.0 per cent, down from its previous hopes of between 5.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent.

The outcome of US–EU trade talks also weigh heavily on Volkswagen’s future. Potential tariffs range between 10 and 27.5 per cent depending on negotiations, and a blanket 30 per cent duty threatened by the US after August 1–currently less than a week away–could further impact forecasts.

Despite the headwinds, VW says it will continue to persist with its long-term transformation, including a shift toward electrification and a €15 billion cost-saving plan—though any near-term payoff remains elusive.

Volkswagen already has been hit by a 25 per cent tariff hike imposed by Washington on imported vehicles, which came into effect earlier this year as part of a broader protectionist trade policy.

The company estimated these increased duties have cost it around €1.3 billion in the first half of 2025 alone.

To shield its American consumers from the full impact of the price increases, VW temporarily absorbed the additional costs, further squeezing margins. North American sales by volume fell 16 per cent over the same period, however, primarily due to these tariffs.

The underperformance of the premium Audi and Porsche brands was especially damaging given their historic role in boosting profitability during industry downturns.

While Volkswagen’s shift to electric cars continues, sales of electric vehicles remain less profitable than their combustion-engine counterparts.

Margins in the electric vehicle segment are under pressure from high production and development costs, ongoing supply chain adjustments, and limited pricing flexibility.

Despite growing demand, EVs deliver weaker returns and contributed to the company’s overall margin contraction.

Volkswagen cited a significant decline in earnings from China, one of its most important markets.

The group is also incurring high restructuring costs as it overhauls its global operations.

This includes a landmark agreement struck with unions last year to cut 35,000 jobs in Germany by 2030, part of a cost-saving programme aimed at reducing annual expenses by €15 billion.

These transformation efforts, critical for long-term competitiveness, are currently adding short-term financial strain.

“The Volkswagen Group has held its own in an extremely challenging environment,” argued CEO Oliver Blume, citing “improved product design, quality, and software integration”.

“In a challenging global market environment, our sales figures remain stable”, Blume added.

Big update from @vooi_io 👇
They’ve just entered a new phase that could change how we trade in DeFi no bridges, no gas fees, no wallet headaches.
Let’s break it down step by step ✌️

Imagine having one wallet that works across multiple blockchains Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, etc.
and you can trade on all of them without switching anything.

That’s the idea behind VOOI V2, and it’s live.

There are now two ways to use VOOI

✅ VOOI Light – for beginners and casual users
✅ VOOI Pro – for advanced traders

Let’s explore what each one does and how they make DeFi way easier 👇

🟣 VOOI Light (New)

Think of this as DeFi with training wheels but smart ones.

– Deposit once (like USDC)
– Trade on multiple blockchains
– No gas fees
– No wallet popups
– No switching chains

Just click → and trade. That simple.

You don’t need to understand “bridges,” “signatures,” or “gas.”
VOOI Light handles everything behind the scenes.

It’s kind of like using Uber:
You don’t need to know how GPS or payments work you just press the button and ride.
🔵 VOOI Pro

This one’s for traders who want:
– Custom TP/SL (take profit / stop loss)
– Live price tracking
– Full control of leverage and orders
– Access to top DEXs like GMX, SynFutures, KiloEx

It’s still simple, but packed with features.
New features just added (July 2025):

🔹 TP/SL for KiloEx, Ostium, GMX
🔹 Shows liquidation price before trading
🔹 Easy leverage slider
🔹 Real-time fee and funding display

So you know exactly what you’re getting into with each trade.
🎯 VOOI Points Program

VOOI now rewards you just for using the platform.
Whether you trade, refer friends, or explore the mini app you earn points.

Points = future rewards, benefits, and maybe more 

The points system runs across:
– VOOI Light
– VOOI Pro
– Telegram Mini App

That’s right VOOI even has a Telegram app where you can practice trading with no real money.

🤖 Telegram Mini App
In this app, you can:
– Try out trading using “play money”
– Learn how trades work
– Earn rewards while learning
– Compete on leaderboards

Perfect for newbies or anyone curious about DeFi.
Behind all this is a clean goal:
Make DeFi trading feel like using a mobile app
✅ Easy
✅ Familiar
✅ Low-risk
✅ No tech friction

And VOOI is executing this one step at a time.
Let’s recap the July updates:

– ✅ VOOI Light beta is live: gasless, bridgeless, beginner-friendly
– ✅ Pro traders get full control with VOOI Pro
– ✅ Points system now rewards trading and referrals
– ✅ Telegram Mini App helps you learn & earn
– ✅ TP/SL tools + more integrations added

VOOI isn’t pitching “what if.”
They’re shipping real tools to make DeFi usable for everyone whether you’re a casual user or a trading nerd.
No gas? ✅
No bridges? ✅
No excuses. ✅
If you’ve been waiting for a sign to try DeFi again
without the headache of chains, wallets, or missing tokens
this might be your moment.

It is a big victory of the US military-energy complex, but doesn’t change the big picture. 

🔹Europe will buy expensive American oil/gas

🔹Europe will buy lots of American weapons

🔹US will impose 15% tariff on European goods, which are worth $600 billion a year. Thus, Trump will collect $90 billion of extra tariff revenue per year. That’s only 0.3% of US GDP. 

🔹Europeans are NOT going to buy gargantuan American pickup trucks and SUVs, regardless of tariff rates

2025-07-28 16:12:36+00:00,"China Ditches U.S. LNG as Russian Pipelines and Domestic Output Surge:

""Over the past couple of years, China has become the world’s largest importer of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), surpassing Japan as the top buyer of super-chilled gas since 2021. China’s surging LNG imports have been shaping Asian energy flows, with the country accounting for more than 40% of the continent's total LNG import growth. However, China’s dominance in LNG markets now appears in jeopardy, and we are seeing a prolonged decline in imports.

According to ship-tracking data by Kpler via Bloomberg, China’s LNG imports are estimated to have clocked in at 5 million metric tons in June 2025, good for a hefty 12% year-on-year decline, marking the eighth straight month of declines. In the first four months of the year, China’s LNG imports slumped to 20 million tons, a sharp fall from 29 million tons from last year’s comparable period. Full-year imports for the current year are now expected to fall 6–11% to 76.65 million metric tons.

This trend appears to defy earlier projections for China’s LNG demand to continue growing through 2035. This, coupled with ongoing shifts in the country’s oil import dynamics, signals major changes in global energy flows. In 2023, China averaged 9.5 billion cubic feet per day in LNG imports, with Australia supplying 34% of total imports; Qatar 23%, Russia 11% and Malaysia 10%.

There are several factors driving this unexpected trend. First off, China has seen a significant increase in pipeline imports from Russia and Central Asia, as well as a 6% increase in domestic gas production, both lowering LNG demand. Pipeline gas accounted for 41% of China’s 16.0 Bcf/d natural gas imports in 2023, with Russia (via the Power of Siberia 1 pipeline), Turkmenistan and Myanmar supplying the majority.

Russia is actively increasing its pipeline gas exports to China as part of its strategy to reorient its energy exports away from Europe and towards Asia, with China as the leading target. Specifically, the Power of Siberia 1 pipeline is expected to reach its full capacity of 38 billion cubic meters (bcm) by 2025, and a new pipeline, Power of Siberia 2, is planned to further increase exports to China by an additional 50 bcm per year. Russia is also exploring other potential pipeline routes to China, including one that would transit through Kazakhstan. This could further expand export capacity and provide alternative routes to diversify supply.

Second, trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have forced China to halt U.S. LNG imports since March 2025 after Trump slapped a punitive 125% tariff on its key trading partner. Consequently, China redirected purchases to Asian suppliers like Qatar and Indonesia.

Third, weak industrial demand due to slowing growth by China’s industrial and chemical sectors has taken a toll on gas demand. These pivotal sectors are experiencing a slowdown due to a combination of factors including a broader economic slowdown, a struggling real estate market, weaker global demand for exports, and reduced foreign investments. To exacerbate matters, China's GDP growth is projected to slow down in the coming years despite showing resilience against U.S. tariffs, with forecasts suggesting growth below the official target and a further easing in 2026. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has projected that China’s economic growth will moderate from 5.0% in 2024 to 4.7% in 2025 and 4.3% in 2026. Finally, a milder winter has lowered demand for residential heating particularly in northern China.

China’s falling LNG imports are having ripple effects across global energy markets. Weakening demand is freeing up LNG volumes, easing supply pressure to other Asian countries including Japan and India as well as Europe. Falling Chinese demand is also depressing Asian spot LNG prices, with prices dropping to $11/MMbtu in May 2025 from a February peak of $16.50/MMBtu. Chinese buyers tend to turn to pipeline gas and domestic production whenever Asian gas prices exceed $10/MMBtu.

Finally, the halt of U.S. LNG exports to China threatens long-term contracts worth 20 million tons per year with U.S. suppliers. Chinese LNG buyers are now reselling U.S. cargoes to Europe and also seeking new deals with  Asia-Pacific and Middle Eastern suppliers, undermining U.S. export growth.""",Energy

President Trump keeps stacking economic wins! Yesterday, he sealed a massive deal with South Korea: $350 billion in U.S.-owned manufacturing investments, $100 billion in natural gas purchases, and a 15% tariff on their exports to us with zero tariffs for our goods going there. No price hikes for consumers; South Korean businesses eat the cost. Same with India’s stalled 20% tariff talks. Trump’s leveraging tariffs for peace, too, ending the Thailand-Cambodia conflict by threatening trade bans. Plus, he’s tackling Big Pharma, demanding 17 U.S. CEOs lower drug prices by September 29 to match Europe’s rates, ending Americans overpaying for prescription drugs.

That said, it’s also disappointing to see tariffs on other Canadian goods increase to 35%. These tariffs hurt both Canadian and American businesses and workers, and they weaken one of the most important trade and security alliances in the world.

In recent months, I’ve met with dozens of governors, senators, members of Congress, and allies of the current administration. I remain convinced that the path to a positive resolution with our U.S. partners lies in strong, consistent diplomacy and a commitment to working in good faith toward shared priorities.

One thing is abundantly clear: Canada must become economically stronger. The federal government must immediately repeal the Trudeau-era laws that restrict resource development and are holding our economy back, and diversify and grow our export markets. This new Liberal government has yet to do so, and it is costing Canada tens of millions in lost economic activity every single day.

The accusation from Stephen Miller, a top aide to President Donald Trump, was made on August 3, 2025, claiming that India’s purchase of Russian oil is effectively financing Russia’s war in Ukraine. Miller stated on Fox News’ ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that India, alongside China, is a major buyer of Russian oil, describing it as an “astonishing fact.” 

This follows Trump’s escalation of pressure on India, including a 25% tariff on Indian goods effective August 1, 2025, and threats of an additional unspecified “penalty” due to India’s energy and military equipment purchases from Russia. 
Trump has also threatened 100% tariffs on countries buying Russian oil unless Moscow reaches a peace deal with Ukraine by August 8, 2025.
India, however, has maintained its stance, with government sources confirming on August 2, 2025, that it will continue purchasing Russian oil, citing long-term contracts and economic considerations. 
Russia supplies about 35% of India’s oil imports, making it the top supplier, with India importing approximately 1.75 million barrels per day from January to June 2025. Indian officials argue that these purchases, made below the EU’s price cap, help stabilize global oil prices. 
The Ministry of External Affairs emphasized India’s “time-tested partnership” with Russia and its energy sourcing decisions based on market prices and national interest.Analysts suggest Trump’s focus on India may be a negotiating tactic or a reflection of frustration with Russia’s lack of progress on a Ukraine ceasefire.

🇷🇺⚡️ EU Quietly Ramps Up Russian Gas Imports — Rising 37% in July 2025— Even as U.S. Targets India Over Moscow Energy Ties @StephenM 

While Washington continues to chastise New Delhi for maintaining energy ties with Moscow, fresh data reveal a contrasting Western strategy. Russian pipeline gas exports to Europe surged 37% month-on-month in July, climbing to 2.65 billion cubic metres, according to Reuters calculations. Despite loud geopolitical rhetoric, European buyers are steadily ramping up purchases through routes such as Ukraine and Turkey, benefiting from price drops and supply stability. The increase underscores the EU’s pragmatic dependence on Russian energy, even amid sanctions and efforts to diversify. The development exposes a growing East-West double standard as India faces mounting U.S. pressure to rethink its Russian engagements.

Let’s break it down:

➜ Chain Abstraction Model
You deposit once.
Then trade across multiple chains with a single balance.
No need to bridge. No need to switch.
It’s all handled behind the scenes. Smooth, gasless, seamless.

➜ Unified Access to DEXs
VOOI plugs into multiple protocols:
Orderly, KiloEx, SynFutures, Hyperliquid, Ostium.
So you’re not stuck with one venue or one asset type.
Trade crypto, stocks, forex, indices, and even commodities.

➜ Smart Order Routing
VOOI doesn’t just connect chains.
It optimizes routes across DEXs for best price execution.
That means less slippage. Deeper liquidity. Better trades.

➜ Gasless Trading
The platform eats the gas.
You focus on trading, not calculating gas or reloading wallets.
That’s real UX innovation.

➜ Multi-Protocol & AI-Enhanced
Supports both EVM and non-EVM chains.
Plus AI trade assistants and Telegram mini-apps
for trading directly inside your socials.
Yes, that’s real.

➜ CEX-like Experience, DeFi Security
You stay in control of your keys.
But you get the performance, convenience, and feel of a centralized exchange.
The best of both worlds.

In short:
VOOI is what DeFi trading should feel like in 2025.
Chain-abstracted. Gasless. User-first.

A no win situation of tariffs and sanctions that would cause widespread disaster to the US economy, especially oil, forced Trump into a corner after Russia's partners did not back down.
Having backed themselves into a tight spot, they became the first ones to blink with Witkoff carrying the message.
Be in no doubt, Trump asked for  the meeting with Putin and not the other way round.
For the Russians to be talking of a deal acceptable to them there must have been some very large concessions indeed by America.
Everyone around the world will be hoping this a genuine offer but always beware of Greeks bearing gifts is a good yardstick here.
Not that America did not have some success in gaining what they wanted by tying Russia up in a war at home they were able to  overthrow Assad in Syria.
On the Ukraine front it had only one positive result which was the total capitulation and embarrassing surrender of Europe and it's extremely weak leaders.
In the space of three years most of the bigger countries in Europe have had their economies ruined and many Western leaders have fallen on the sword of supporting Zelensky.
Marcron, Merz and Starmer  along with Von Der Leyen should be next.
Oh and don't forget that Nobel peace prize so desperately wanted.
The truth however is far different, with sanctions and tariffs against Russia having the opposite effect and Russia having unprecedented growth and on the battlefield it was an utter disaster.
The problem being that as Russia thrived and Europe and America nose dived, weapons were unavailable to keep Ukraine going much longer, catastrophic Ukrainian losses were a major factor too.
America will, of course, claim a glorious victory that fools nobody, it is a humiliating climb down wrapped in golden sunshine so bright one might require sunglasses.
Champagne all round, happy days are here again alright  !!?
But the summit meeting with Putin took three hours of convincing to get Putin to agree to a summit meeting that was floated some time ago.
The really wide awake among the world leaders will see right through this. Trump's actual standing underneath the bluster and fanfare takes a large hit and Putin's stock for the moment, has risen.
The spin of the account of the meeting by America should set alarm bells ringing.
The rhetoric of course will be that Putin folded and Russia made a mistake not getting the truth out but the Russians don't really care for spin.
There is nothing signed and sealed and Russia have conceded nothing so far.
An improvement in relations is not linked to a solve in Ukraine, even though America will spin it as such.
Putin is in no hurry, it is America and Europe in a rush and Zelensky is so desperate he will fly to wherever they meet if abroad, in the vain hope of being invited to sit with the big boys.
As for European leaders they will be briefing Zelensky like men possessed trying to look relevant on the world stage, when they are nothing but gallery watchers.
Europe and the Neocons will be beside themselves with fury that Trump may have woken up to his perilous position at the eleventh hour.
One should remember that Kissinger once said that being an enemy of America was dangerous but being a friend of America is absolutely lethal.
Something the nobodies of Europe and the comedian of Ukraine have still to learn.
The men of Ukraine have learned this at a terrible cost.

📈 Progress: EV sales up from 50K (2016) to 2.08M (2024), but only 7.6% penetration vs. 16.5% global. Strong in 2/3-wheelers, lagging in cars & trucks.
🚨 Challenges: High costs, limited charging, low awareness, data gaps.
🇮🇳 India’s Context: 75% two-wheelers, short trips, small operators dominate.
🛠 Solutions:
- Shift to mandates (ZEV targets, ICE taxes).
- Focus on buses, trucks (4% fleet, >50% emissions).
- Electrify 5 cities fully in 5 yrs.
- Fund low-cost loans for e-buses/trucks.
- Subsidize services, not assets.
- Promote battery/vehicle leasing.
- R&D for cheaper batteries.
- Build charging hubs on 20 corridors.

Here’s How to Keep Your Trade Safe When the Market Gets Bumpy.

Picture this,You’re cruising on your bike, wind in your face, heart racing and you know the road ahead has some unexpected bumps. 

Do you just pray nothing goes wrong? Nah, you strap on a helmet. Same vibes in trading ETH at $4k.

The market’s wild, and while you’re all in, there’s no shame in playing it smart. 

That’s where hedging steps in your trading helmet. 

Instead of jumping off your ride (closing your position) at the first sign of trouble, 

Instead you set up a backup plan like opening a trade that moves against your original one ( yeah that’s what we call  hedging in trading/crypto terms).

Like an insurance policy that cushions the fall if the market throws a curveball.

Why’s this clutch?
•You keep your original position alive, chasing those big gains.
•You dodge those panic moves when prices start to wobble.
•You keep control, not emotions, steering your trades.

Let’s say you bet ETH’s gonna blast upwards, but the shadows of a dip haunt you. 

You open a short position to hedge if ETH dips, your short makes up some ground, softening the blow.

No need to bail out early. You stay in the game, ready for the next big wave.

So if you want the play-by-play on setting up your hedge and managing it like a pro? 

For now, trade smart, keep that helmet tight, and remember Vooi’s got your back on every move.

Why now?
It is clear, if you take emotions out, that he knows about India's oil exports, as well as economic growth.
He has stopped short of criticising Modi personally, though he has criticised pretty much every other leader.
It has to be a diversionary tactic - the real game is being played elsewhere and possibly on the Russian-Ukrainian front.
Recall the previous fiasco when Zelensky was sent back home from the White House after missing his lunch? The thought was that he would capitulate, and he made some signals but that quickly faded as EU and UK stepped in with more aid and got the Ukrainians going.
India's oil is keeping the EU going, by sanctioning India, Trump is signalling for EU to stay out while he settles Ukraine - Russia will keep what it has, US will get it's rights, India/China will  get something (oil or part of rebuilding or peacekeeping forces) and EU will be reassured by some means (oil or weapon withdrawal).

🔻 Public Kashmir “mediation” claim humiliated Modi
🔻 Pakistan’s generals welcomed (twice with nuclear sabre rattling), India snubbed
🔻 China punished less than India
🔻 Quad unity now in doubt

📌 Punishing partners harder than rivals is bad geopolitics.

When Policy Becomes a Farmer’s Biggest Threat
by JakePosted onAugust 13, 2025

China’s canola tariffs show how Ottawa’s choices can cripple Canadian agriculture.

Farmers can handle a lot, from droughts to floods, rising input costs, and volatile markets. We manage risk for a living. But there’s one threat we can’t outwork, outsmart, or insure against: our own government’s policies. It doesn’t have to be this way—government policy could be-should be-one of our greatest assets.

Farmers used to worry far more about other matters in the past: weather, markets, input prices, even labour. Obviously, these are all critical drivers of our income year to year, and how we manage these determines our long-term success in this business.

Risks We Can Control
That last point is key—those are manageable pieces of our business. I can manage labour challenges. I can manage input and capital costs to keep my costs low. Careful, strategic management of these factors can make a tremendous difference to farm profitability over time.

I can also buy insurance to protect me against a bad year, or maybe two (some farmers in long-term droughts would rightfully insist that insurance only goes so far). Some insurance can even protect revenue itself, which also helps with commodity price collapses. I can also pre-sell crops, sometimes with production contracts that give me an out for bad weather, and some on futures markets that don’t commit me to physical sales.

There is a lot I can at least partially control. The more I manage my risk, the better my farm is likely to perform across decades.

Government policy, though, is not controllable. It is not predictable. Increasingly, it is not rational. And it is incredibly impactful.

Chinese Tariffs: A Critical Blow
On August 12, 2025, China announced they would be imposing a 75.8 percent duty on Canadian canola seed imports, effective August 14th. This isn’t their first attack on Canadian canola: on March 20, 2025, China also slapped a 100 percent tariff on Canadian canola oil and meal. These two actions essentially close the door on this market.

What’s the impact? In 2024, we exported $4.9 billion worth of canola, including seed, oil, and meal, to China. This is a critically important market. And let’s not forget the serious impact on peas, pork, and other products China has targeted. It isn’t just canola.

The Real Reason Behind China’s Move
Why is China doing this? Oh, there’s some claimed “dumping” of canola into Chinese markets and subsidies to Canadian farmers from our government. But that is simply an excuse. Canadian farmers are subsidized far less than many other countries, including most European countries and the United States.

The real reason is because Canada imposed a 100 percent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles in October of 2024. This was supposedly done to protect Canada’s auto industry. China is striking back to pressure the Canadian government.

Ottawa’s Choices Matter
The federal government made a choice last October and continues to make the same choice today: sacrifice Western Canada for Eastern Canada. The auto industry is a key source of votes in the East. The West is not.

The canola industry is worth $43 to $45 billion, employing 200,000 people. It alone, without considering any of the other crops we grow out West, is significantly larger than steel, aluminum, and auto manufacturing combined.

This doesn’t need to be a competition, though. Every industry in Canada is essential to its short and long-term prosperity. All we’re asking is to be treated equally —to be offered the same level of support and attention the auto industry gets when trade barriers arise.

Doesn’t the Canadian Government Already Support Farmers?
Our federal and provincial governments cost share part of the cost of our crop insurance system. They also provide a revenue stabilization insurance product called AgriStability, which recently got a couple of needed improvements. Obviously, crop insurance doesn’t protect farmers against commodity price collapse, as that is a yield protection product only.

AgriStability does – but its support levels are so far below profitability that farmers are losing a lot of money before it kicks in. And that is a common misconception: AgriStability cannot help us in this situation, not really. What the loss of the Chinese market does is remove our profit margin. AgiStability will not kick in to protect a profit, only reducing losses. This product cannot help us here.

Farmers are bearing the burden of government policy protecting one industry to spite another–one that’s orders of magnitude larger. We have spent the money on this crop. Our investment is in. The fertilizer, herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides are applied. The fuel is burned, the machinery used. And now, on the brink of harvest, we just lost our profit margin on one of our most important crops.

China knows exactly what it’s doing. They knew how to hit us where and when it hurts the most. But are they overestimating how interested our federal government is in doing something about it?

This is Far Bigger than Farmers
This action by China isn’t just an attack on farmers—it’s an attack on all of Canada. This affects everyone, all across this country.

The policies our governments, federally and provincially, put in place have an enormous impact on our livelihoods. From investment in crop breeding and infrastructure, to developing and maintaining trade agreements and market access, to providing insurance backstops, government policy matters.

Something Must Change
It’s time for our government to stop biting the hand that feeds it. It’s time to recognize the enormity of the Canadian agriculture. The success of farmers across this country drives the prosperity of millions of Canadians. Yet, time and again, the government enacts policies that actively damage agriculture. From ill-conceived climate policy, to falling investment in critical Agriculture Canada breeding programs, to repeated diplomatic blunders that alienate key export markets. Something must change.

Agriculture is one of Canada’s largest industries, providing 8 percent of GDP and one in eight jobs. It could be one of Canada’s crown jewels—a target for strategic investment and clear, consistent policy to ensure success for generations. Government policy can, should, must be an asset to Canadian farmers, not a burden.

Something must change. Canadians, if there ever was a time to talk to your MP’s and tell them why agriculture matters, it’s now.

While the federal government says it will stand up for Canadian farmers and industry, it continues to underwrite a $1 billion loan for BC Ferries to buy ships from a state-backed Chinese shipyard that undercuts Canadian companies on environmental standards, worker safety and wages.

This makes no sense. Canadian workers are capable of building world-class ships, with Canadian steel, aluminum, and technology, here at home.

Germany – Chancellor Olaf Scholz came to Canada asking for LNG. Trudeau said no. Germany signed massive LNG deals with Qatar and the United States instead.

Greece – PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis wanted Canadian LNG. No deal. Greece turned to Egypt and other Mediterranean suppliers.

Poland – President Andrzej Duda asked for Canadian LNG. Rejected. Poland ramped up imports from the U.S. and Norway.

Japan – PM Fumio Kishida sought long-term LNG supply. Trudeau said climate goals came first. Japan inked contracts with Australia and Qatar.

So here we are—after years of missed opportunities—finally admitting we have something the world wants. Too bad our customers already found new suppliers.

No business case? No, just no political will.

2025-08-14 23:23:50+00:00,"Gas fees are crypto's biggest UX nightmare.

Every time you trade, swap, or mint, you're forced to play a guessing game:

Will it cost $2? $20? $200?

It’s like going to Starbucks and not knowing if your latte costs $5.10 or $15.30 until the cashier hits the button.

@ETHGASofficial wants to fix this by making blockchain feel like Netflix:

- Flat, predictable pricing
- No surprises at checkout
- Click, confirm, done

Here’s how it works:

Protocols (L1s, L2s, apps) pool their users’ gas fees with ETHGas.

ETHGas reimburses users through a rebates program, so the user sees a simple, fixed fee.

Protocols hedge the risk of variable gas in the background.

The user experience? Instead of worrying about spikes or crashes, you just interact with apps. Same way Netflix hides all the messy bandwidth, servers, and licensing deals. You just hit “play.”

That’s the endgame: gas as a subscription, not a gamble.

Shoutout to @lepsoe & @ruthybuilds for breaking this down so clearly.

SULAIMANI, Kurdistan Region — Turkey has been ready to restart oil exports from the Kurdistan Region via Ceyhan Port since October 4, 2023, Turkish Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar announced on Thursday, noting that the pipeline is fully operational and Ankara has received encouraging signals from Baghdad.

In an interview with Sky News, Turkish Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar said Turkey has received messages from Iraqi counterparts indicating plans to restart oil flows. He added that Ankara has been ready since October 4, 2023, and can immediately transport the oil through Ceyhan to global markets.
He added that Turkey has recently informed the Iraqi government it is seeking a new framework for oil transportation, as the existing Iraqi-Turkish pipeline agreement does not meet Ankara’s expectations nor current global energy standards.

Bayraktar also revealed that he recently met with Iraqi Oil Minister Hayyan Abdul-Ghani in Vienna and informed him that Ankara does not intend to renew the current agreement as is, but has sent a new draft. “I believe they are now reviewing and trying to understand its structure,” he added.

Disclosing Turkey’s objectives in the new draft, Bayraktar said Ankara’s goal is to fully utilize the pipeline, which has a capacity of 1.4 to 1.5 million barrels per day.

He also said Turkey is now waiting for Iraqi technical teams to begin talks on a new deal to utilize full pipeline capacity.

Brussels wants to cut off all Russian gas imports by 2027, but Turkey says it won’t play along - refusing to adopt EU rules that track fuel origins.

That creates a backdoor risk: Russian gas could keep slipping into the bloc disguised as other supplies. 

Analysts warn Turkish pipelines and LNG terminals could “mix” flows before sending them into Bulgaria or Greece, making it nearly impossible for Brussels to prove what’s Russian and what’s not.

Turkey insists it only follows UN sanctions, not EU ones, and hinted it might “cooperate” if Brussels revives frozen energy talks or offers investment sweeteners.

Tariffs, Visas, and the Real Balance of Power Between the U.S. and India

The setup

President Trump has leveled a 50 percent tariff on Indian goods, citing New Delhi’s continued purchase of Russian oil. India’s official response has been calm, but under the surface both sides are gaming out the next moves. At stake are not just trade balances, but agriculture, technology, immigration, and the long-term question of who really holds leverage.

Scene One: Washington Briefing

Advisor A: The tariff is in place. Jewelry, textiles, seafood — all will bleed. Exporters in India will feel it by next quarter. If they want relief, we demand movement on Russia and farm access.
Advisor B: Our real lever is immigration. Cut H-1B approvals, slow renewals, clamp down on OPT. We finally force Big Tech to hire the U.S. STEM grads we’ve been leaving on the bench.
Advisor C: Farmers in Iowa want access for dairy and grain. Tech CEOs want the visa spigot left open. Make India’s concessions the price of keeping both.

Scene Two: New Delhi Strategy

Advisor 1: Exports take a hit, but 60 percent of our GDP is domestic consumption. We can absorb some pain. Protect farmers at all costs.
Advisor 2: Washington says they have engineers to replace our people, but their companies don’t want to retrain or pay. They want us because we are cheaper and compliant. That remains leverage.
Advisor 3: We already opened doors for Harley-Davidson, bourbon, Tesla. That buys time. If oil talks shift, the tariff justification weakens.

Prime Minister Modi: Farmers are our red line. They carried us to power. We will trade optics, not outcomes.

The Lobbies Speak

Tech CEO (California): “Cut visas and you slow product launches. We’re addicted to Indian talent.”

Farm Bloc (Midwest): “Open India’s markets or keep the tariffs. Voters are watching exports.”

U.S. STEM Grad: “We’re here, qualified, and sidelined. Stop importing substitution labor.”

Indian Exporter: “Currency drop helps, but a 50% tariff on gems and jewelry is a $10 billion problem.”

Data Snapshot

Bilateral trade 2024: $212.3B (Goods $129B, Services $83.4B)

U.S. goods deficit: $45.8B

India’s top exports to U.S.: Electronics ($11.1B), Jewelry ($9.9B), Pharma ($8.1B), Machinery ($6.2B), Refined petroleum ($5.8B)

GDP hit estimate: –0.6% if all exports face 50% duty (~$23B)

Dairy opening cost to India: $20B, half borne by farmers directly (SBI Research)

Seafood exports at risk: ~$3B annually
Three Paths Forward

Path A – The Deal
India trims select farm barriers, buys more U.S. energy.
U.S. keeps headline tariff but carves out exemptions. H-1B continues with tighter fraud checks.
Winners: U.S. farm states, Indian negotiators, Big Tech.
Losers: Protected Indian sectors facing pilot openings.

Path B – The Squeeze
U.S. signals visa caps, strict degree-job matching, and longer audits.
India pivots exports to Gulf, ASEAN, Russia, China. Keeps farm walls high.
Winners: U.S. STEM grads, U.S. farm lobby if India yields late.
Losers: Indian IT margins, U.S. firms hooked on cheap imported labor.

Path C – The Pause
Oil diplomacy cools things. Tariffs linger but aren’t enforced evenly. Immigration policy drifts.
Winners: Status quo actors.
Losers: Anyone needing clarity to invest.

The Leverage Map

U.S. Hard Levers: 50% tariffs, H-1B rules, OPT tightening, defense tech access.

U.S. Constraints: Farmers want exports, Tech wants visas, Voters want U.S. grads employed.

India Hard Levers: Farm walls at 60–80% on dairy and rice, services market access, procurement deals.

India Constraints: Farmer vote, opposition watching, exporters screaming.

The Innovation Myth

Silicon Valley insists Indian H-1Bs are “indispensable innovators.” The truth: they are cost substitutes. Real U.S. innovation still comes overwhelmingly from U.S. citizens and permanent residents. The bottleneck is not skill, it is wage suppression. If Washington recognizes this, the immigration lever shifts decisively.",Energy

ERBIL (Kurdistan24) – Iraqi Planning Ministry spokesperson Abdul Zahra Hindawi announced on Tuesday that oil exports from the Kurdistan Region are “in progress” following recent negotiations, and that an agreement has been reached on non-oil revenues.

Hindawi said a Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) delegation met with the Iraqi government’s ministerial committee in Baghdad to discuss oil exports and internal revenues.

“The meeting discussed the export of oil from the Kurdistan Region, and related issues have been finalized. The resumption of exports is imminent,” Hindawi told Kurdistan24.

He added that both sides also addressed the Region’s internal revenues, reaching a preliminary agreement to adjust them, with further talks expected in the future. “The results of today’s meeting will be presented to the Iraqi Council of Ministers for an appropriate decision,” he said.

The Iraqi committee was chaired by Minister of Planning Muhammad Ali Tamim and included Justice Minister Khalid Shwani, Minister of Construction and Housing Bangin Rekani, Health Minister Salih al-Hasnawi, Higher Education Minister Naeem al-Aboudi, and Industry Minister Khaled Battal.

The KRG delegation was led by Umed Sabah, President of the Diwan of the Council of Ministers, accompanied by Secretary of the Council Amanj Raheem and eight directors general from the Ministry of Finance and the Financial Supervision Bureau.

Good question.

Traditionally, Russian oil exports were priced and sold in U.S. dollars (like most global oil trade), because the dollar is the world’s primary reserve and settlement currency.

However, since 2022—after Western sanctions and restrictions on Russian banks—Russia has been shifting away from the dollar:
•Rubles: In March 2022, Russia required “unfriendly countries” (mainly the EU) to pay for natural gas in rubles, though this was less applied to oil. Some oil contracts have since been settled in rubles.
•Chinese Yuan: China is now Russia’s largest buyer of oil. A growing share of Russian crude sold to China and other Asian partners is priced and paid in yuan (renminbi).
•Indian Rupees: India buys a large portion of discounted Russian oil, often settling in rupees, sometimes via intermediary banks.
•Dirhams (UAE): Some trade also uses UAE dirhams as a neutral settlement currency.

🔑 Summary:
•Pre-2022 → mostly U.S. dollars
•Post-2022 → mix of rubles, yuan, rupees, dirhams, and still some dollars, depending on the buyer and sanctions workarounds.

Every cycle in crypto has a theme.

Last time it was scalability. Gas was too high, chains were slow, and Alt L1s like Solana, Luna, and Avalanche stepped in to fix that. SOLUNAVAX became the trade.

But today, infra isn’t the problem anymore. Gas is cheap. Networks are fast.
So the real question becomes ' what do people actually do once they’re onchain?'

The answer this cycle is simple: People want Yield.

Liquidity is the hook.
Utility expands the opportunity.
Value capture makes it sustainable.

And this is why $Plume feels like the cleanest expression of the Yield Meta to me. It isn’t just another protocol chasing attention with incentives,  it’s an ecosystem where every piece (Nest, pUSD, fees, RWAs) ties back to users and their yield.

2025-08-20 19:58:05+00:00,"Pushing DeFi to the Next Level: Why Better UX is the Key, with GOAT Network Leading the Charge

DeFi has changed how people borrow, lend, trade, and earn yield without intermediaries. Yet adoption is still slow. Most users find DeFi difficult to navigate. Wallet setups, gas fees, cross-chain bridges, and technical jargon create barriers that push many away.

The most effective way to grow DeFi is through better user experience. Incentives may bring temporary attention, and regulation takes time. UX, on the other hand, delivers immediate impact by making DeFi safer, easier, and more approachable.

Why UX Matters

Makes onboarding simple for newcomers.

Reduces costly errors and security risks.

Builds trust and long-term retention.

Expands participation beyond crypto-native users.

Creates a cycle of growth, with more users leading to more liquidity and stronger ecosystems.

I will be using @GOATRollup  as an Example

Launched in 2024 as a Bitcoin Layer 2, GOAT Network focuses on sustainable BTC yield. Users can stake BTC or DOGE and earn yield directly from sequencer fees. The design is intentionally simple, avoiding complex mechanics that overwhelm beginners.

During its pre mining campaign, the project attracted $8 million worth of BTC and DOGE, showing early trust. Its BTC Yield Dashboard highlights clear products:

GOAT Safebox with 2% APY for low-risk users.

BTCB/DOGEB Vault with 10% APY for more active DeFi participants.

The platform avoids synthetic assets and custodial bridges, keeping transparency at the core. Onboarding is gamified through the “One Piece Project,” offering guides, NFTs, and point-based rewards. The ecosystem extends with GOATSwap, Oku, and Artemis Finance, giving users tools for swapping, staking, and farming.

Why Users love goat Network 🫡 

1) Smooth bridging between Bitcoin L1 and GOAT L2 has been achieved. A new improvement was made today.

2) Trust minimized bridge using BitVM2.

3) Decentralized sequencer staking that feels open and fair.

4) Clear yield options with visible risk levels.

5) Gamified participation that encourages ongoing engagement.

6) Balanced appeal for both serious BTC holders and meme driven traders.

The Lesson to be learnt here

Better UX is the most direct driver of DeFi adoption. GOAT Network shows how simple onboarding, transparent products, and engaging participation make a difference. Incentives and regulation still play roles, but UX solves the accessibility problem today. For DeFi to scale, platforms must focus on making participation effortless without losing sight of security and transparency.

Behind much of this growth is the expansion of production from states like Texas, which set a new high for natural gas marketed production earlier this year in March 2025, reaching 34.4 billion cubic feet per day.

As LNG becomes a defining force in global energy dynamics, the ability of U.S. producers to meet demand is key. Texas continues to lead on that front, with record-setting output and strong infrastructure positioning the state as the cornerstone of U.S. natural gas exports. The trends in 2025 reflect a broader shift in which domestic energy policy, global geopolitics, and the capacity to deliver are tightly interlinked, making Texas natural gas not just a regional asset, but a global one.

For centuries, Europe’s strength has rested not only on its own productivity, but on what it could extract, control, or purchase cheaply from Africa. The colonial empires of Britain, France, and others turned African resources into the lifeblood of European industry. Later, even after decolonization, Europe continued to draw on African oil, gas, uranium, cobalt, and food exports to sustain its prosperity. This external supply chain allowed Europe to mask its own demographic decline, its lack of raw materials, and its increasing dependency.

Today the illusion of independence is fading. Europe does not have the energy reserves to power itself, nor the rare earths to sustain a modern digital economy. Its agriculture relies on imported fertilizers and food flows connected to Africa. The continent that once dictated terms now finds itself vulnerable. If Africa withholds or redirects its resources — toward China, Russia, or its own internal development — Europe faces shortages, inflation, and industrial decline.

The uncomfortable truth is that Europe is not self-sufficient and never has been. Its power has always depended on Africa being weak, divided, and open to exploitation. Now that Africa asserts itself and diversifies its partners, Europe is left exposed. Climate change may one day alter the planet, but Europe’s collapse may come sooner — when the flow of oil, gas, minerals, rare earths, and agricultural exports from Africa slows, and the continent realizes how little it can do on its own.",Energy

2025-08-23 18:01:06+00:00,"Shadow Fleet: The Secret Oil Armada Defying Western Sanctions

By Sea and Coast News Network | Exclusive Report

New Delhi, August 23, 2025 – As Western sanctions tighten their grip on Russia’s energy exports, a clandestine maritime world has emerged in defiance: the shadow fleet – an armada of aging, disguised oil tankers that deliberately evade international scrutiny.

Sources confirm that India’s Nayara Energy Ltd., partially owned by Russian oil major Rosneft, has turned to this shadow fleet to keep crude oil imports and refined fuel exports alive after the EU placed the company under sanctions in July. Traditional shippers backed out under pressure, forcing Nayara to cut crude runs – but the shadow fleet has stepped in to fill the vacuum.

A Fifth of the World’s Tankers Gone Dark

Industry trackers estimate the size of the shadow fleet at 1,200–1,600 vessels, nearly 20% of the world’s tanker capacity. These ships thrive in regulatory blindspots, deploying deceptive tactics to mask their identities:

Flags of Convenience – registered under lax jurisdictions like Liberia and Panama.

AIS Manipulation – switching off or spoofing Automatic Identification Systems to “vanish” at sea.

Ship-to-Ship Transfers – oil is offloaded in remote waters to conceal origins.

Identity Laundering – frequent renaming, reflagging, and shell company ownership transfers.

Dubious Insurance – operating without valid cover, endangering crew, cargo, and coastal states.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) only officially recognized “dark ships” in 2023, highlighting how far enforcement lags behind the problem.

Russia’s $10 Billion Dark Armada

Since 2022, Russia has built the backbone of this global network. The Kyiv School of Economics estimates Moscow invested $10 billion to secure its own tanker fleet, which now carries 70% of Russia’s seaborne crude exports.

Much of this fleet consists of vessels sold by European owners – notably Greek shipping groups – and quietly transferred to shell operators in opaque jurisdictions. Networks such as 2Rivers reportedly control over 100 ships ferrying Russian petroleum under layers of secrecy, despite US and UK sanctions on specific vessels.

By bypassing the G7’s price cap, Russia reportedly earns an extra $9–10 billion annually, fueling its war economy.

India’s Calculated Stance

As the world’s third-largest oil importer, India has refused to accept unilateral Western sanctions, honoring only United Nations-backed measures. This position allows Indian refiners to continue purchasing discounted Russian crude – even when transported aboard sanctioned or shadow fleet vessels.

For New Delhi, this isn’t merely opportunism but energy security strategy. Cheap Russian oil cushions inflation and secures supplies for a growing economy.

Growing Global Alarm

Western powers are increasingly alarmed. Germany has begun insurance verification checks on tankers entering the Baltic Sea, while NATO’s “Baltic Sentry” program monitors suspected sabotage and shadow ship activity.

Yet enforcement remains patchy. The sheer scale of the shadow fleet, coupled with flag-hopping, opaque ownership, and weak maritime governance, makes comprehensive crackdowns nearly impossible.

---

The Bigger Question

The rise of the shadow fleet signals more than just defiance of sanctions – it exposes the limits of Western leverage in global energy trade. For importers like India and China, it is a practical workaround; for operators, it is a profit windfall; and for the West, it is a strategic headache.

Ultimately, this murky parallel fleet demonstrates the futility of unilateral sanctions and the double standards of a maritime system where economic necessity consistently trumps compliance.

According to him, the EU’s commitment is “a politically motivated, stupid decision that they are trying to refine endlessly, instead of going back to basics and asking the question: who is in the best interest of all this?” 

Hernád also finds it concerning that Hungary and Slovakia’s supply also depends on a single pipeline, the Adriatic pipeline, which is risky. 

“What happens if a natural disaster takes out two kilometers of pipeline? What happens if the Barátság pipeline (a pipeline called ""Friendship"" that runs through and through Ukraine)  is shut down? They won’t restart it. We are hanging on to a single pipeline – this is nonsense,” 

 According to Hernádi, it is a simplistic idea that the basis of Mol's success is Russian crude oil. ""This is not true in itself. The basis of Mol's success is a very strong infrastructure, a complex refining capacity and the fact that we can effectively exploit synergies."" 

He said that currently the gas station network is one of the engines of the group, although previously this sector was only considered a ""necessary evil"".",Energy

Because nothing says ""strategic partnership"" like economic punishment for energy pragmatism. India's crime? Securing affordable oil for 1.4 billion people while Uncle Sam plays global hall monitor with his tariff stick. 📊

The alleged ""economic devastation"" India faces? Well, when you've been juggling trade wars, currency fluctuations, and supply chain chaos for decades, what's another tantrum from across the Atlantic? India's economy has survived worse storms than Washington's theatrical trade theatrics. 🌪️

Meanwhile, India continues its chess game - diversifying trade partnerships, strengthening domestic manufacturing, and probably having a good chuckle over chai about America's selective moral outrage over energy choices. Because apparently, energy security is only acceptable when it aligns with DC's geopolitical mood swings. ☕️

The real comedy? Thinking a 50% tariff will make India abandon pragmatic energy policies. Spoiler alert: It won't. India's been playing the long game while others throw economic tantrums. 🎯

The city sources nearly all its energy needs, including oil, coal, gas, and nuclear-generated power, from abroad and re-exports a portion, which exposes it to global energy price volatility and supply risks. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s economy remains resilient. In the first half of 2025, merchandise exports grew by roughly 12 percent year on year, highlighting the city’s strong regional trade connections and export performance. GDP growth held firm at 3.1 percent in Q2, marking ten consecutive quarters of expansion.

Beyond trade, Hong Kong stands out as an Asian leader in green and sustainable finance. In 2024, it facilitated approximately US$43.1 billion in international green, social, sustainability, and sustainability-linked bonds, representing 45 percent of Asia’s total cross-border sustainable debt issuance. The city continues to advance green-fintech innovation, having launched the world’s first multi-currency tokenized green bond and actively supporting digital bond issuance through targeted grants and regulatory frameworks.

🔹 What GAIB Does
GAIB transforms GPU power into an on-chain, tokenized asset. That means anyone can tap into real compute, stake into AI infrastructure, and capture upside from the growing demand for AI training and inference. Instead of GPUs sitting idle, GAIB channels them into an open economy.

🔹 Why It Matters
The AI industry is exploding ,but GPU access is still fragmented, expensive, and dominated by centralized players. GAIB breaks this bottleneck by:
•Making GPUs tradable like commodities
•Letting users earn yields from real compute supply & demand
•Building a decentralized economic layer for AI infrastructure

🔹 Recent Highlights
•Community mint completed with strong demand 
•Free NFT drop this week (already seeing traction in secondary markets)
•Early adopters tapping into GAIB’s staking pools and compute flows
•Building partnerships across Web3 & AI ecosystems

🔹 Looking Ahead
GAIB isn’t just another AI project it’s a shift in how we think about infrastructure. As more devs, creators, and enterprises need GPU power, GAIB positions itself as the marketplace where compute meets liquidity.

The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Oil and Gas Free Trade Zone Command, has intensified collaboration with enterprises operating in the zone to promote trade facilitation and enhance revenue generation.

Customs Area Controller, Comptroller Immaculata Nyong, disclosed this after a three-week tour of facilities and enterprises in the zone. The exercise, which ran from 29 July to 19 August 2025, covered companies including Seplat Energy, ESSO Exploration and Production Nigeria (FZE), TotalEnergies, Onne Multipurpose Terminal (OMT), West African Container Terminal (WACT), Technip FMC Nigeria Ltd, Baker Hughes, One Subsea Offshore Systems Ltd, Intels Nigeria Ltd, Oil Tools Africa Ltd, Titan Tubular Nigeria (FZE), Hamilton Technologies Nigeria Ltd, and Brawal Oil Service Ltd (FZE).

Comptroller Nyong, accompanied by senior command officers and officials of the Oil and Gas Free Zone Authority, engaged with operators, received operational briefings, and inspected ongoing activities.

She explained that the tour was designed to strengthen stakeholder collaboration, ensure regulatory compliance, facilitate legitimate trade, and boost Federal Government revenue.

“Trade facilitation cannot be achieved in isolation. Our goal is to build synergy with enterprises in the Oil and Gas Free Zone, address concerns, and sustain an enabling environment for businesses to thrive,” she said.

While many operators commended the NCS for its openness and active engagement, some raised concerns about operational challenges, particularly regarding the B’Odogwu clearance system.

In response, Comptroller Nyong reassured stakeholders of the Service’s commitment to resolving such issues and improving efficiency in line with the Comptroller-General of Customs’ mandate.

She further emphasised that the command would maintain regular engagements with operators to ensure smooth operations and strengthen Nigeria’s competitiveness as an oil and gas logistics hub.",Energy

2025-08-25 20:02:38+00:00,"China’s Tariffs on Canadian Peas
In March 2025, 

China imposed retaliatory tariffs of 100% on imports of Canadian peas (along with canola oil and meal), effective March 20, 2025. This was in response to broader trade tensions, including Canada’s tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and other goods, amid escalating U.S.-initiated trade wars under the Trump administration. The tariffs have severely disrupted Canadian pea exports to China, a major market for pulses. Prior to the tariffs, Canada exported hundreds of thousands of tonnes of yellow peas to China annually (e.g., about 500,000 tonnes in 2024, valued at over CAD 300 million). The duties have rendered these exports uncompetitive, causing a sharp drop in demand, oversupply in other markets, and downward pressure on prices. As of August 2025, the tariffs remain in place, with industry groups like Pulse Canada and Alberta Pulse Growers highlighting the “devastating” impact on the sector. The Canadian government has provided support for affected farmers, but resolution remains uncertain amid ongoing global trade frictions.
Current Pea Prices in Western Canada (as of August 25, 2025)
The tariffs have exacerbated a bearish market for yellow peas in western Canada (primarily Saskatchewan and Alberta, which account for over 90% of production), leading to significantly lower prices due to lost Chinese access, increased domestic production (seeded area up ~9.5% to 1.42 million hectares for 2025-26), and softening global pulse demand from northern hemisphere harvests. This has resulted in oversupply and muted export opportunities to alternatives like India or Europe. Prices vary by variety, region, and delivery terms (e.g., farmgate vs. delivered to elevator), with yellow/feed peas bearing the brunt of the decline. Recent reports confirm farmgate and spot bids in western Canada have fallen to as low as CAD 6.00 per bushel for yellow peas, reflecting the user’s observation of “but ow $6.00 a bushel” (interpreting this as “but now $6.00 a bushel” amid the tariff-induced slump). This is a notable drop from earlier 2025 levels (e.g., new crop bids were $1.50–2.00 higher in July) and the 2023-24 crop year average of ~CAD 11.54–12.45 per bushel for 1CAN grade field peas. While some delivered bids remain higher, farmgate prices in Saskatchewan and northern Alberta are indeed at or below CAD 6.00/bu in spot markets, signaling distress for producers. Here’s an updated summary based on mid-to-late August 2025 data:",Energy

Fuse Energy is not just an energy supplier. It’s a full-stack clean energy company. They generate solar & wind, supply electricity and gas to households, trade on wholesale markets, and deploy smart installations at scale.

On top of that foundation, Fuse is launching the Energy Network. A crypto-native coordination layer where households connect solar panels, batteries, EV chargers, and smart thermostats. When they shift demand or export power, they earn $ENERGY, redeemable for bills or hardware.

Today Fuse powers 50,000 UK homes, generates $90M ARR, and operates 18 MW of renewables with 1 GW in development.

Why the Energy Network matters
> The Dept of Energy estimates 100x increase in blackouts by 2030.
> AI, EVs, and data centers are driving unprecedented strain on grids, pushing prices higher and volatility wider.
> Of the 209 GW of new generation expected by 2030, only 22 GW will be dispatchable baseload. Leaving a massive shortfall in reliable supply.
> The Energy Network flattens peaks, cuts reliance on dirty peakers, lowers costs, and shares value directly with users.

How does it work?

1. Customers link EV chargers, home batteries, thermostats, and solar via the Fuse app.
2. Fuse forecasts local generation, demand, and grid stress in real time.
3. During peak periods, the Energy Network automatically reduces demand by shifting or pausing loads and discharging storage.
4. Users earn $ENERGY proportional to their verified flexibility and local exports; tokens are burned on redemption for bills and hardware - closing the loop.

Who’s behind Fuse?
> CEO Alan Chang (ex-CRO, Revolut)
> COO Charles Orr (ex-Strategy Lead, Revolut)
> Alumni from Tesla, SpaceX, Jump, Jane Street, Citadel
> Backed by $100M from tier 1 investors including Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko

Why $ENERGY is compelling
- Real-world utility earned only from measurable grid services.
- Direct value redeemable against energy bills and smart hardware.
- Deflationary by design with a fixed supply of 10B tokens, with every redemption burning supply and strengthening scarcity.
- Built on Solana for speed, scale, and composability.

Why care?
Fuse is rebuilding the energy stack end-to-end, and the Energy Network brings users directly into the value chain. Clean energy at scale, with crypto-native upside.

2025-08-27 19:38:01+00:00,"U.S. tariffs of 50 percent took effect Wednesday, Aug. 27, on many Indian products, doubling an existing duty as U.S. President Donald Trump sought to punish New Delhi for buying Russian oil.

Trump has stepped up pressure on India over the energy transactions, a key source of revenue for Moscow, as part of a campaign to end the Ukraine conflict.

While Trump has slapped fresh duties on allies and competitors alike since returning to the presidency in January, this 50-percent level is among the highest that U.S. trading partners face.

However, exemptions remain for sectors that could be hit with separate levies, including pharmaceuticals and computer chips.

The Trump administration has launched investigations into these and other sectors that could culminate in further duties. Smartphones are in the list of exempted products as well.

Industries that have already been singled out, such as steel, aluminum and automobiles, are similarly spared these countrywide levies.

The United States was India's top export destination in 2024, with shipments worth $87.3 billion.

But analysts have cautioned that a 50 percent duty is akin to a trade embargo and is likely to harm smaller firms.

New Delhi has criticized Washington's move as ""unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.""
The world's fifth-largest economy is looking to cushion the blow, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi promising to lower the tax burden on citizens during an annual speech to mark India's independence.

Modi earlier vowed self-reliance as well, pledging to defend his country's interests.
Russia accounted for nearly 36 percent of India's total crude oil imports in 2024.

India plans to increase Russian crude imports by 10–20% in September (150,000–300,000 bpd), defying U.S. tariffs that rose to 50% this week.

2025-08-29 16:44:00+00:00,"🚨 Exposing TARRIFS Hypocrisy:

Facts vs. Claim

The attack on India over Russian oil is a textbook case of double standards. While the Trump administration imposes punitive 50% tariffs on Indian goods and brands India a “money laundromat” for Russia, the United States itself quietly sustains and even expands, its trade with Moscow.

➡️ America’s own dependency on Russian commodities tells the real story:

Despite a 2024 law banning Russian Uranium, Washington imported $596 million worth in the first five months of 2025 alone, a 28 percent year-on-year jump, under waivers that remain valid until 2028. Fertilizer imports touched $806 million, up 21 percent, while palladium imports rose 37 percent to $502 million. All of these are exempted because they are considered “strategic necessities” for American industry and food security.

The overall trade picture is just as striking. In 2024, US-Russia bilateral trade amounted to $3.5 billion, with the US running a $2.4 billion trade deficit with Moscow. Between January and May 2025, American imports from Russia rose another 23 percent, reaching $2.1 billion. Meanwhile, Europe’s exposure to Russian energy dwarfs both the US and India. The EU imported $41 billion worth of Russian goods in 2024, including record LNG purchases of $8.5 billion. France alone accounted for 37 percent of Europe’s Russian LNG intake.

By contrast, India’s record reveals a steady diversification. The Russian share of Indian arms imports has fallen to 36 percent from 55 percent a decade ago, with France and the US steadily rising as suppliers. India also exported $84.2 billion worth of refined petroleum in 2024, much of it to Europe, countries fully aware that these products were refined from Russian crude.

The hypocrisy is clear. The US defends its own Russian Uranium and Fertilizer imports as unavoidable because there are “no alternatives,” yet it penalizes India for purchasing crude vital to its energy security. Mr. Navarro’s charge that India acts as an “oil money laundromat” ignores the fact that Western economies remain far more dependent on Russian commodities than India ever was. What emerges is not a matter of principle, but of selective trade politics; shielding OWN interests while punishing others.",Energy

This move aligns with Trump's broader strategy to isolate Russia economically, forcing allies to align with US sanctions or face trade barriers, while India prioritizes energy security and $17 billion in savings from Russian crude to fuel its growth. 

The tariff risks slashing India's exports by 43% to $49.9 billion annually, eroding 1% of GDP and triggering mass unemployment in labor-intensive sectors like textiles and jewelry, where competitors like Vietnam gain ground. Delhi's countermeasures—urging domestic purchases, tax reductions to 5-18%, and exporter aid packages—reflect resilience but underscore vulnerabilities in over-reliance on the US market.

What do Trump’s 50% tariffs really mean for India and its markets? Market veteran Ramesh Damani argues that while exporters like textiles and jewellery will feel the heat, India’s 1.4 billion-strong domestic economy provides a powerful cushion. He calls Trump’s tariff war a “self-goal” that will hurt America more than India, and explains why the bull market that began post-Covid remains alive - even if consolidation is ahead.

Jefferies Says It’s Personal, Not Trade

Donald Trump’s battle with India isn’t about oil, tariffs or trade, it’s personal. This week, his aide Peter Navarro revealed the truth in a slip-up that speaks louder than any policy paper. In a thread attacking India’s oil trade with Russia, Navarro posted a photo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi meditating in saffron robes, a loaded image meant to stereotype India’s civilisational roots.

But behind the symbolism lies Trump’s real motive. According to investment banking giant Jefferies, U.S. tariffs on India stem from Trump’s personal frustration, his “pique” after being denied a role in mediating between India and Pakistan. Trump has falsely claimed over 40 times that he brokered peace between the two nations. Modi publicly denied it, and the humiliation still stings.

Now, Navarro has become Trump’s most aggressive enforcer, spinning lies and taking cheap shots. From branding India’s trade “blood oil” to calling policies “madness,” his hypocrisy is clear. This trade war isn’t about economics, it’s revenge.

DeFi promised to simplify finance, but the reality is that the traditional DEX model often slows things down. Every trade comes with hidden struggles,  gas fees, liquidity sourcing, front-running bots, even picking the right chain. For most users, it feels like too much work.

Velora changes that completely. Instead of forcing you to manage all the details, Velora is built on an intent-based design. You don’t have to figure out the “how”, you just set your goal, and Velora takes care of the execution in the smartest way possible.

Here’s why that matters:

Super Hooks → Run complex cross-chain scenarios in a single flow. No more bouncing between bridges and wallets.

Delta Mechanism → Trade without worrying about gas or MEV attacks. Your transactions stay smooth and protected.

Yield Optimizer → Get access to the highest returns instantly. Velora does the heavy lifting so you don’t miss opportunities.

With support for 12 chains and 160+ integrations, Velora is built for both everyday users who want simplicity and institutions who need flexibility. And with ParaSwap’s proven foundation behind it, this isn’t just theory, it’s infrastructure that works.

👉 The bottom line: Velora makes DeFi feel fast, safe, and rewarding, without the usual headaches.

2025-09-02 17:55:39+00:00,"Tariff Impact: Oil Flow to India Declines, Russian Cargoes Now Head Toward China
News Tanks | September 2025

The direct impact of U.S. tariffs on India is now being seen in Russia’s oil exports. The flow of Russian oil toward New Delhi has recorded a sharp decline, while China has taken advantage of the situation by ramping up its purchases.

U.S. President Donald Trump recently doubled import duties on goods coming from India to 50%. This step was taken as a punishment for India’s continued crude oil imports from Russia. As a result, oil shipments from Russia to India have dropped by about one-third compared to March.

According to a report, by August 31, the average crude flow to India from tankers over a four-week period fell below 1.3 million barrels per day, while in March it was at the peak. Even if all loaded ships eventually reach India, the flow would still remain around 550,000 barrels per day (28%) lower than March levels.

In contrast, China has stepped up its consumption of Russian oil. By the end of August, flows to China rose to 1.28 million barrels per day, the highest in the last five months.

Meanwhile, total weekly crude shipments from Russian ports climbed to a seven-week high of 3.49 million barrels per day, recovering from an earlier unusual slump.

In March 2025, Trump dropped a bombshell EO: 25% tariffs on ALL goods from countries importing Venezuelan oil—starting April 2. Why? To cut Maduro’s cash flow and gain leverage over top buyer China amid trade wars on fentanyl & IP. Educational note: “Secondary tariffs” punish third parties, like hitting China’s exports to hurt their oil deals. 💥 

China imports 500K-650K barrels/day from Venezuela—over half its exports! This repays $10B debt, but Trump’s tariffs could stack to 45-70% on Chinese goods like steel.    Result? Trade stalled initially, exports dropped 11.5% in March, but held steady overall as oil gets rebranded via Malaysia. Prices up ~1%, hurting everyone. 🤔 

Pros: Weakens China’s Latin America grip (600+ deals!), forces trade concessions, boosts U.S. energy dominance.   Cons: Oil’s fungible—China pivots to Russia/Iran; could spike U.S. inflation; past sanctions failed to topple Maduro.   Fact: Venezuela’s May exports steady despite sanctions.

Dear @OndoFinance,

Here’s the truth about Ethereum in 2025:
•Block Time: ~12 seconds
•Finality: ~12 minutes on average
•Gas Fees: ~$280 per trade

So users wait 12 minutes to buy a stock they could purchase on Robinhood in 500ms—while burning hundreds in fees. That’s not DeFi innovation, that’s a pagers-and-fax-machine era chain dressed up as progress.

Why Ethereum Fails for RWAs & DeFi at Scale
•Latency kills adoption. Institutions can’t operate on settlement times that feel like dial-up.
•Costs block growth. Paying $280 gas makes micro-trades, retail entry, and global financial inclusion impossible.
•User experience is broken. Nobody waits 12 minutes for a stock order in the real world.

Why Internet Computer (ICP) is Built for the Future
•Finality in ~2 seconds. Near-instant settlement that competes with Nasdaq speeds.
•Gas at near-zero. Fractions of a cent per transaction—cost doesn’t scale with congestion.
•Web-speed UX. Apps run natively on-chain at internet speeds, no MetaMask pop-ups or clunky bridges.
•Scales horizontally. ICP is the only L1 that can host full Web2-scale apps (social, RWA marketplaces, trading platforms) entirely on-chain.
•Chain-key crypto + direct integrations. ICP connects to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and beyond without bridges—removing systemic risk.

The Bigger Picture
•Ethereum is a bottleneck. Legacy design, slow throughput, high gas—completely misaligned with real-world finance needs.
•ICP is an enabler. Tokenized stocks, RWA settlement, DeFi apps, social apps—all on-chain, all running at web speed.
•2025 isn’t about experiments—it’s about production-ready finance. Users expect instant, cheap, and secure. Ethereum simply can’t deliver that.

We don’t use pagers and fax machines in 2025. Why should DeFi still run like it’s 2015?

ICP > Ethereum. Always.

That’s why ETH holders are divorcing their bags—and moving their future into ICP.

Secure, Measured, Scalable,  Proven, Quantum-Proof.

U.S. President Donald Trump has issued a stern warning to India, hinting at phase-2 and phase-3 sanctions if India continues its oil trade with Russia. 

Speaking on The Scott Jennings Radio Show, Trump said India “got big problems” after ignoring his earlier cautions, stressing that additional tariffs had already cost Russia “billions of dollars.”

Trump blasted India for being “the most highly tariffed nation in the world,” claiming that only under his tariff pressure did India offer a no-tariff deal. 

He asserted that without strong measures, India would never have made such concessions.

His remarks come as U.S. political circles debate the legality of his heavy tariffs on India, with a federal appeals court recently ruling the 50% duties unlawful. 

Despite this, Trump doubled down, presenting tariffs as a powerful tool to hold India accountable for enabling Russian oil revenues.

This renewed warning highlights India’s vulnerability: its deep reliance on Russian energy is now under direct fire from Washington, with the threat of harsher punitive measures looming large.

The sanctions, which doubled tariffs on Indian goods to 50 percent, took effect on August 27 and, Trump claimed, have already cost Moscow “hundreds of billions.” In an Oval Office meeting with Polish President Karol Nawrocki, Trump dismissed suggestions of inaction against Russia, stressing India had been forewarned. 

White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said the move reflected Trump’s “unparalleled” foreign policy, noting his strong ties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

2025-09-04 16:08:39+00:00,"REQUEST FOR COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT NET BILLING REGULATIONS

1. Nigeria's solar energy capacity has experienced significant growth in recent years. In 2023, solar panel imports were valued at over $200 million, translating to more than four million panels, with a substantial portion allocated to captive power generation. By Q1 2025, the value of imported solar panels had reached approximately ₦125.29 billion. This expansion reflects the increasing adoption of renewable energy, particularly in rural and off-grid areas, driven by government initiatives and private sector investments. In 2024, Nigeria added 63.5 MW of solar capacity, bringing the total installed capacity to 385.7 MW, further accelerating the shift towards decentralized energy solutions.

2. Given this expansion, stakeholders have approached the Commission with requests to explore the possibility of implementing a net metering arrangement, enabling the export of excess power back into the grid for commercial value. In compliance with its Business Rules and pursuant to Sections 46 and 48 of the Electricity Act (EA) 2023, which govern the Commission’s proceedings, consultations, and public hearings, the Commission has developed draft regulations on net billing.

3. The Commission is inviting the general public to provide comments on the draft net billing regulations which can be accessed at https://t.co/SYpWAFMufg. All comments, submissions, and further inquiries should be directed to: netbillingregulations@nerc.gov.ng. Submissions can be made until 26 September 2025.

4. While anticipating constructive contributions to the draft regulations, please accept the assurances of the Commission's best wishes.

🤔🏌🏾‍♂️🤔🏌🏾‍♂️🤔🏌🏾‍♂️🤔🏌🏾‍♂️🤔🏌🏾‍♂️🤔🏌🏾‍♂️🤔🏌🏾‍♂️🤔

ERBIL, Kurdistan Region of Iraq – Negotiating delegations from Erbil and Baghdad on Thursday met in the Iraqi capital to iron out the final details of an agreement on the outstanding issues between the two governments, relating particularly to the issues of the handover of the Kurdistan Region's domestic revenues to the federal government and of the resumption of the Region’s oil exports.
The meeting yielded no solutions to the issues between the two governments regarding the Kurdistan Region's handover of domestic non-oil revenues and resuming oil exports, The New Region has learned.
The New Region understands that the federal government insists that the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) hand over 100 percent of the domestic revenue generated in the Region.
Erbil and Baghdad are in agreement over the protocol for resuming oil exports, however, the International Oil Companies (IOC) operating in the Region require guarantees that they will be compensated 16 US dollars for each barrel of oil produced, a requirement that Baghdad has refused to guarantee as of the time of writing this article.
The Kurdish delegation’s visit was preceded by another delegation that left for Baghdad on Tuesday to discuss solutions with representatives from the federal government toward the same issues, focusing mainly on the resumption of oil exports.
Iraqi Finance Minister Taif Sami, in a letter addressed to the KRG in late May, claimed that Erbil had already exhausted its share of the 2025 federal budget, saying that the finance ministry will no longer fund the Region’s civil servant salaries; as a result, government employees in the Kurdistan Region have gone months at a time without receiving their due payment.
Civil servants in the Region received their salaries for June in September, while July and August salaries have yet to be funded by the Iraqi government. The KRG has time and again reiterated that they have “more than fulfilled” their obligations relating to finding solutions with Iraqi authorities.

2025-09-04 19:08:56+00:00,"TXOGA's Quarterly Perspective for 2025 Q3 is now available! Read here: https://t.co/aetRNBoWwd

Global economic risks—from trade policy to fiscal deficits—have been slower to materialize than many expected, leaving markets in a “soft landing” holding pattern. Yet uncertainty persists, and the real test for the U.S. outlook is whether record-high equities can continue sustaining consumer spending as corporate costs rise.

Against this backdrop, TXOGA’s latest outlook highlights several key themes:

✅ Global oil demand keeps setting records through 2026, even as EIA projects supply growth will outpace demand. With U.S. inventories still low, the downside risk in official forecasts depends on assumptions that Saudi Arabia and Russia will flood the market—an outcome that remains far from certain.

✅ Natural gas demand also reaches new highs, with roughly 85% of incremental LNG capacity growth in 2025 coming from North America. Texas continues to lead U.S. production, supported by new LNG export projects along the Gulf Coast.

✅ Texas shale productivity remains resilient. Gains in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins, even with fewer rigs, underscore efficiency improvements that keep supply steady.

The common thread: Texas oil and natural gas remain steady in a turbulent global environment. That stability provides a foundation for reliability and growth, but it is not a guarantee. Continued investment, operational discipline, and readiness for sudden change will remain critical for the state and nation to sustain their competitive advantage.

Putin counters with calls for US-Russia-China trilateral projects, signaling openness despite tensions.

EU energy chief demands permanent ban on Russian imports
Moscow has long warned that cutting its oil and gas will damage the bloc’s economy
https://t.co/62KW8Qcn8y
The European Union must permanently cut off all Russian energy imports, Commissioner for Energy and Housing Dan Jorgensen has declared.

Most EU countries have halted direct imports of Russian crude and gas under sanctions over the Ukraine conflict. However, Brussels continues to push for a full phase-out of Russian energy by the end of 2027 under its RePowerEU Roadmap. The plan calls for ending spot gas contracts, suspending new deals, limiting uranium imports, and targeting the so-called Russian “shadow fleet” of oil tankers allegedly used to bypass sanctions.
Jorgensen, who has championed the plan for months, said the bloc must urgently agree on its framework and stick to it even after the Ukraine conflict ends.
“For us the objective is very, very clear. We want to stop the import as fast as possible,” he told reporters in Copenhagen on Friday. “And in the future, even when there is peace, we should still not import Russian energy… In my opinion, we will never again import as much as one molecule of Russian energy once this agreement is made.”...link to read full article",Energy

The conversation made one point clear: Africa’s green transition will only succeed when renewable energy projects are designed as complete ecosystems - bringing together policy, finance, and industry.

Boukhalfa Yaïci (Director General, Green Energy Cluster Algeria – GEC’A), Shenhong Yao (Director, Division of Strategic Planning & South-South Cooperation, @UNIDO ), Helen Aigbe Brume (Director & Global Head, Project & Asset-Based Finance, @afreximbank ), and Pradeep Paulose (Programme Officer, SPP/SSC, @UNIDO  – Moderator) shared insights on how to make this possible. 

The message was consistent: investors need visibility of future pipelines, governments must provide policy stability, and industries must have clarity on where to build capacity.

Algeria’s 3.2 gigawatt renewable programme was highlighted as an example of this approach in action. By mandating local content, opening tenders to domestic firms, and financing through local banks, it is not only adding clean power but also creating industries in cables, transformers, steel, and engineering.

The forum closed on an optimistic note: with the right frameworks, Africa’s renewable energy story will be measured not just in megawatts installed but in industries built, jobs created, and futures secured.

Moscow has long warned that cutting its oil and gas will damage the bloc’s economy

The European Union must permanently cut off all Russian energy imports, Commissioner for Energy and Housing Dan Jorgensen has declared.

Most EU countries have halted direct imports of Russian crude and gas under sanctions over the Ukraine conflict. However, Brussels continues to push for a full phase-out of Russian energy by the end of 2027 under its RePowerEU Roadmap. The plan calls for ending spot gas contracts, suspending new deals, limiting uranium imports, and targeting the so-called Russian “shadow fleet” of oil tankers allegedly used to bypass sanctions.

Jorgensen, who has championed the plan for months, said the bloc must urgently agree on its framework and stick to it even after the Ukraine conflict ends.

“For us the objective is very, very clear. We want to stop the import as fast as possible,” he told reporters in Copenhagen on Friday. “And in the future, even when there is peace, we should still not import Russian energy… In my opinion, we will never again import as much as one molecule of Russian energy once this agreement is made.”

Jorgensen noted that the US has backed Brussels’ plans. President Donald Trump, frustrated with slow Ukraine peace talks, urged European allies on Thursday to halt Russian energy imports. The July trade deal between Washington and Brussels also included a pledge that the EU would replace Russian oil and gas with American LNG and nuclear fuel.

Hungary and Slovakia, both heavily dependent on Russian supplies, have been the strongest opponents of the phase-out, arguing it would undermine the bloc’s security and raise prices. On Friday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto accused the EU of “hypocrisy,” saying many members still buy Russian crude through intermediaries even as they call for a phase-out. Jorgensen said he was in talks with Budapest and Bratislava but noted the plan can be approved without them, as it requires only a qualified majority.

""The sanctions imposed by the US Treasury Department are not related to Iraqi ports and oil exports, but to individuals who own private companies and transportation, so these have nothing to do with SOMO,"" SOMO Director General Ali Nizar Shatri told reporters.

""We are committed to all guidelines and decisions to protect Iraq's assets,"" he said.

""A network of companies run by Iraqi businessman Salim Ahmad Saeed will buy billions of dollars worth of Iranian oil from at least 2020 onwards, mixing it with Iraqi oil,"" the Treasury Department said in a statement.

Tariffs, Russian Oil, SCO Summit Test India-US Ties

India-US ties are facing their most turbulent period in years, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump attempt to balance personal rapport with sharp disagreements over trade and energy. Trump recently doubled tariffs on Indian goods to 50 percent, punishing New Delhi for continuing Russian oil purchases, even calling India a “laundromat for the Kremlin.” India, instead of retaliating, chose to strengthen its domestic market by reforming the Goods and Services Tax to boost household consumption. 

Meanwhile, at the SCO Summit in Tianjin, images of Modi walking with Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin fueled US anxieties over shifting global alliances. Trump publicly vented frustration, later softening his stance by emphasizing friendship with Modi. Modi responded diplomatically, stressing strategic partnership. With Jaishankar set to address the UNGA and Putin’s visit expected later this year, India continues its delicate balancing act between East and West.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has endorsed US President Donald Trump’s decision to double tariffs on Indian goods to 50%, including a 25% penalty on New Delhi’s Russian oil imports.

Speaking to ABC, Zelensky said Moscow’s energy trade remains “Putin’s weapon against Ukraine” and welcomed Trump’s move.

“I think the idea to put tariffs on countries that continue to make deals with Russia is the right idea,” Zelensky remarked when asked about PM Narendra Modi’s recent meeting with Putin in China.

The move risks escalating trade tensions between Washington and New Delhi, already strained by Trump’s aggressive tariff policies.

This is not a drug war, but a robbery and a colonial war

According to the former Director General of the UN Office in Vienna and Executive Director of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (merged into the UN Office on Drugs and Crime), with the rank of Under-Secretary-General, the world's leading expert on drugs, Pino Arlacchi:

""This is another attempt by the US to interfere in a country that - according to the UN - has eradicated cocaine, marijuana and others, as well as the cartels that controlled their trade.

The geopolitics of oil disguised as a war on drugs. During my tenure as head of UNOC, the UN agency for drugs and crime, I have been to Colombia, Bolivia, Peru and Brazil, but I have never visited Venezuela.

There was simply no need. The cooperation of the Venezuelan government’s record on combating the drug trade was among the best in Latin America.

The country was full of problems, but it was not involved in the production, trafficking, or even consumption of hard drugs.

These are verified facts that today, in Trump’s delusional narrative of “Venezuela as a narco-state,” clearly show that these are geopolitically motivated slanders.

The analyses from the World Drug Report 2025, published by the organization I had the honor of leading, tell the exact opposite story to that propagated by the Trump administration. They shatter the fiction of the Cartel de los Soles—an alleged supercartel as legendary as the Loch Ness Monster, but suitable for justifying sanctions, embargoes, and threats of military intervention against a country that—coincidentally—sits on some of the largest oil reserves on the planet.

The recently released UN report on 2025 is crystal clear and should shame those who have been behind the demonization of Venezuela. The document mentions Venezuela only in passing, stating that only a negligible part of Colombian drug production passes through its territory to the US and Europe.

According to the UN, Venezuela has consolidated its historical position as a country without growing coca, marijuana, etc. – and without the presence of international criminal cartels.

The document only confirms 30 previous annual reports that do not mention the Venezuelan drug trade at all, because it simply does not exist.

Only 5% of Colombian drugs transit through Venezuela. A full 2,370 tons – ten times more – are produced or traded by Colombia itself, and 1,400 tons pass through Guatemala.

The “Cartel de los Soles” is a figment of Trump’s imagination. It is not mentioned in UN documents, nor in European or other international agencies. Only the DEA in the US refers to it – and that on the basis of classified data that would certainly not be secret if they had a real basis and confirmation from elsewhere.

According to a European report, cocaine is the second most used drug in the EU. Its main sources are clearly defined: Colombia (production), Central America (distribution) and various routes through West Africa (transportation to Europe). Venezuela and Cuba do not figure in this scenario.

Production: U.S. gas production is still very strong — hovering at record levels despite minor daily declines.

Demand: Power burn remains the dominant demand driver, especially with summer cooling load — but it will ease as shoulder season begins.

Imports/Exports:  LNG exports remain a critical balancing factor — Sabine (+0.8 Bcf), Cameron (+0.1 Bcf), Freeport (+0.06 Bcf) all pulling volumes offshore.

U.S. gas flows show a market still flush with supply (~107 Bcf/d), but LNG exports (+14.6 Bcf/d) and strong power burn (~38 Bcf/d) are keeping balances tighter.

Everyone is working in this direction, and this is cause for optimism. All that remains is Implementation so we are optimistic that it will be achieved soon.” Ali Nasir Faiq, Director General of SOMA

ERBIL, Kurdistan Region - The head of Iraq’s State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO) said on Monday that they are “working to implement the agreed-upon terms” to resume the Kurdistan Region’s long-halted oil exports, with exports expected to restart “soon.” 

Oil companies operating in the Kurdistan Region are demanding a tripartite signed agreement that includes the federal oil ministry and the Kurdistan Region's natural resources ministry to guarantee the payment of their dues.

Faiq stressed that SOMO is ready and “working to implement the agreed-upon terms” to resume the oil exports, stressing that the budget law and its amendments are the “strongest” guarantee for the payment of the companies’ dues. 

Oil exports from the Kurdistan Region through the Iraq-Turkey pipeline have been suspended since March 2023, when a Paris-based arbitration court ruled in favor of Baghdad against Ankara, saying the latter had violated a 1973 pipeline agreement by allowing Erbil to begin exporting oil independently in 2014.

The suspension has incurred $28 billion in lost revenue so far, according to the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). 

The following is the full transcript of the interview with Ali Nizar Faiq:

Rudaw: There was much talk about reaching an agreement between Baghdad and Erbil, but this was followed by reports indicating that no agreement had been reached. Where do we stand now regarding the export of the Kurdistan Region's oil through SOMO?

Ali Nizar Faiq: The question is important, and the issue is even more important. We are directly linked to the issue through the budget law and its amendments. The law stipulates the need to begin pumping the Kurdistan Region's oil in two directions: the first is exporting oil through the oil marketing company that we manage, and the other is domestic consumption. Discussions began based on this foundation to establish the appropriate mechanism for implementing this law and its amendments, including selecting an international consultant and determining its work methodology. Furthermore, the Ministry of Oil appointed Wood Mackenzie as a global consultant. Discussions were also held with the Kurdistan Region's Ministry of Natural Resources, which is responsible for its contracts with producing companies within the Region and the rights and obligations of these companies under the contracts signed with them.

These discussions resulted in SOMO completing all its contracts with the companies purchasing Kurdistan Region oil. We are optimistic that these quantities will arrive and flow into the tanks at the Turkish port of Ceyhan, after which loading will begin normally.

So, based on the agreement, is the buyer currently ready?

Yes. The companies purchasing Kurdistan Region oil are ready. It is Iraqi oil, flowing through Iraqi-Turkish pipelines in accordance with the existing agreement with the Turkish side.",Energy
2025-09-10 18:36:56+00:00,"#1 Tria Series
The first time I saw “Web3 neobank” and “gasless cross-chain” in the same sentence, I stopped scrolling. One app where I can trade, spend, and earn without hopping across wallets and chains? That got my attention. 😎

My crypto routine used to be chaos: load gas in Wallet A, bridge via Tool B, swap on DEX C, then stake from Wallet D. Each step adds friction and fees — newcomers bounce, veterans get tired.

Tria leans into chain abstraction: I express an intent, the infra finds the optimal path and executes — think Google Maps for crypto transactions powered by BestPath AVS, an AI-driven intent marketplace. 🤩

Feature
Right on the homepage @useTria  highlights three pillars:
- AI-Optimised Swaps & Bridges (BestPath auto-routes for speed & cost)
- Real Yields, Not Promises (vetted on-chain strategies with transparent APYs)
- No Gas, No Complexity (stake across chains without juggling gas, bridges, or extra wallets)

In practice, that means fewer steps, fewer mistakes, less opportunity cost. I operate “as if it’s one place,” while BestPath handles the messy parts — routing, liquidity unification, and gas abstraction.

Add the Tria Card and the flywheel spins faster: cashbacks, activity rewards, weekly airdrops, reward multipliers—plus the practical bits: top-up from 1,000+ coins, use it in 150+ countries, accepted at 130M+ merchants, and spend up to $1M/day. This is where crypto meets everyday life.

The legal stack is public — Platform Agreement, Privacy Policy, US & International Card Terms—and the US Cardholder Agreement shows “Last Updated: Jun 23, 2025.” That reads like a shipping product, not just slides.

As more users and partners integrate BestPath/SDK, the intent marketplace thickens — better routes, tighter spreads, faster execution. Just like maps get smarter with more drivers on the road.

I’m diving deeper next. Which do you want first: Tria Card (spend + on/off-ramp in 100+ countries) or BestPath AVS (how the intent engine and chain abstraction actually work)? Drop a comment and I’ll take the whole crew through it. 🥸🥸 @cookiedotfun",Energy

In August 2025, the five largest EU importers of Russian fossil fuels paid Russia a combined EUR 979 mn for fossil fuels. 

Natural gas — unsanctioned by the EU — accounted for more than 61% of these imports, delivered mainly by pipeline or as liquefied natural gas (LNG). 

The remainder was largely crude oil, which continues to flow to Hungary and Slovakia through the southern branch of the Druzhba pipeline under an EU exemption.

Hungary was the EU’s largest importer, purchasing EUR 416 mn worth of Russian fossil fuels. This included EUR 176 mn of crude oil and EUR 240 mn of pipeline gas.

Slovakia ranked second, with imports totaling EUR 276 mn. Crude oil delivered via the Druzhba pipeline made up 74% of the total (EUR 204 mn), while pipeline gas accounted for EUR 72 mn. The derogation allowing Slovak refineries to process Russian crude into oil products and re-export them to Czechia expired on 5 June.

France was the third-largest buyer, importing EUR 157 mn of Russian fossil fuels, all in the form of LNG. However, not all of this gas is consumed domestically — a study shows that some LNG entering through the Dunkerque terminal is subsequently delivered to Germany.

The Netherlands was the fourth biggest importer, importing EUR 65 mn of Russian LNG, while Belgium, in fifth place, purchased EUR 64 mn, also entirely in LNG.

2025-09-11 21:54:45+00:00,"FT:  US to urge G7 to impose high tariffs on China, India over Russian oil purchases:

""The US will pressure G7 countries to hit India and China with sharply higher tariffs for buying Russian oil in an attempt to ""force"" Moscow into peace talks with Ukraine, according to four people briefed on the plans.  

In a video call on Friday, finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading economies will discuss a US proposal for a round of new measures as Donald Trump steps up efforts to broker a peace deal in Ukraine.  The US president this week urged the EU to impose up to 100 per cent tariffs on China and India but is now expanding the push to include G7 allies.  “Chinese and Indian purchases of Russian oil are funding Putin’s war machine and prolonging the senseless killing of the Ukrainian people,” said a US Treasury department spokesperson.  

“Earlier this week, we made it clear to our EU allies that if they are serious about ending the war in their own backyard, they need to join us and impose meaningful tariffs that will be rescinded the day the war ends,” they added.  “President Trump’s Peace and Prosperity Administration is ready, and our G7 partners need to step up with us.”   The spokesperson declined to state a figure for the planned tariffs but people familiar with the situation said the US had proposed levels of between 50 and 100 per cent.   

The US last month increased tariffs on Indian imports to 50 per cent over the country’s purchases of Russian oil. In April, Trump sharply increased tariffs on Chinese imports but scaled them back in May after a severe market backlash.  EU officials know that imposing such steep tariffs on two key trading partners would be difficult given the economic impact and likely retaliation from Beijing. The bloc is hoping to seal a trade deal with New Delhi within weeks as it seeks closer ties with a rising Asian power.  

But Brussels hopes to persuade the US that it can achieve similar pressure through other measures such as tougher sanctions on Russian energy producers and bringing forward a 2027 deadline for its member states to stop buying Russian’s oil and gas.   That, three European officials said, would require Trump to put pressure on Hungary and Slovakia, two countries led by pro-Russian leaders who continue to buy Russian oil via pipeline and have vetoed tougher EU sanctions in the past. 

 The EU is already debating whether to put sanctions on China for buying cheap Russian oil and gas.  Dan Jørgensen, EU energy commissioner, met US energy secretary Chris Wright on Thursday to discuss replacing Russian liquefied natural gas for American supplies.  

“We need, as fast as possible, to make sure that we get rid of the dependency that we still have . . . on Russian energy,” he said.   The EU still buys around a fifth of its gas from Russia, down from 45 per cent before the country’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.   Canada, which holds the G7 presidency and hosted the group’s last summit in Alberta in June, said it called the meeting “following discussions with the US”.   It said they would “discuss further measures to increase pressure on Russia and limit their war machinery”.  

“The G7 is resolved in its opposition to Russia’s illegal and unjustified war,” said John Fragos, spokesperson for Canada’s finance minister.   The talks would include proposals for “tariffs on nations that continue to fund Russia’s war machinery”, said a Canadian government official who spoke on condition of anonymity.   

Ottawa also faces a dilemma over such a move. In June prime minister Mark Carney launched an effort to rekindle relations with India after a two-year rift. Similar overtures have been made to Beijing, as Canada diversifies its economy away from the US.",Energy
2025-09-11 21:57:46+00:00,"🇺🇸🇮🇳The US is ready to resolve trade disputes with India as soon as it stops buying Russian oil.

This was stated by US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnik in an interview with CNBC.

According to him, before the war in Ukraine, only 1% of India's oil imports came from Russia, but now this figure has reached 40%.

""They buy it $7-10 cheaper, refine it, and resell it to the world. The US President called this unacceptable,"" Lutnik said.

Meanwhile, US ambassador nominee to New Delhi Sergio Gore reported that the country's President Donald Trump invited India's Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal to visit Washington next week to discuss a trade deal.

Allies must immediately stop purchasing Russian oil, which Trump describes as ""shocking"" and a major source of lost leverage against Moscow.

Trump also proposes a broader move: NATO should collectively impose 50% to 100% tariffs on China--Russia’s largest oil buyer--until the war ends, after which the tariffs would be lifted.

US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for pressure on Russia's trading partners to stop buying its oil, claiming that it could help end the conflict in Ukraine.

The Financial Times reported last week that Washington asked G7 finance ministers to consider secondary tariffs of 50–100% on Chinese and Indian imports related to Russian oil.

Today Has Been Historical For Iraq 

Here Is Why

The resumption of Kurdistan crude oil exports through SOMO, as announced on September 16, 2025, cannot proceed to full international market integration without an Iraqi Dinar revaluation and Forex listing this year, as global buyers demand transactions in freely convertible currencies to mitigate exchange rate volatility. This agreement, committing the KRG to supply at least 230,000 barrels per day to SOMO for export, generates revenues primarily in USD, which must be repatriated and converted at a stable, internationally recognized rate to fund federal budget obligations, thereby necessitating a revalued Dinar on Forex to avoid black-market distortions and ensure seamless capital inflows. Without this Forex accessibility, SOMO's marketing of Kurdish oil comparable in quality to Russian grades and targeted at European buyers would face pricing inefficiencies, as hedging contracts require a liquid Dinar pair to lock in profits against IQD fluctuations, directly tying the deal's totality to a year-end revaluation for credible global supply chain participation.",Energy

Most people got used to it. Some even call it “the cost of being on chain.”

VeloraDEX looks at it differently. What if trading didn’t have to feel like a fight? What if instead of battling against the system, the system was designed to compete for you?

That’s the essence of intent-based trading. Instead of telling the blockchain exactly how to execute a trade, you just state your intent  “I want to swap X for Y at the best price.” From there, a network of solvers competes to give you the best outcome.

The shift is powerful:

Gasless execution → you only pay when a trade succeeds, no wasted ETH.

MEV protection → bots don’t get to front-run your moves.

Sharper prices → solvers battle each other to fill your order efficiently.

Real traction → $12B+ quarterly volume and 18k+ active traders show it’s more than theory.

Here’s where the curiosity kicks in: if intent-based systems already make swaps safer and cheaper, what happens when this expands? Imagine borrowing, lending, or cross-chain swaps where you never worry about bridges, failed tx, or hidden costs  just your intent, and the system delivers.

That’s what VeloraDEX is quietly building toward. It’s not just about making swaps better. It’s about reshaping DeFi around the user instead of the machine.

So the real question isn’t whether intent-based DeFi works  it’s how soon before it becomes the new standard.

Oil exports from the Kurdistan Region have been a contentious issue since 2014, when the KRG began selling crude independently of Baghdad. I've traded crude oil for 20 years and have watch this drama unfold for years, so this is not surprising.

Disputes over revenue sharing and federal oversight over KRG oil have repeatedly led to disruptions in exports. 

An informed source revealed, on Tuesday (September 16, 2025), that the Council of Ministers concluded its meeting without making a decision regarding the disbursement of salaries to employees of the Kurdistan Region.

The source explained to Baghdad Today that the government is linking salary funding to the implementation of the oil export agreement, stressing that this condition remains an obstacle to the release of funds allocated to the region's employees.

The Kurdistan Region's employee payroll has been complicated for years by disputes between Baghdad and Erbil over oil exports and financial revenues.

The federal government asserts that salary disbursements are linked to the implementation of oil agreements and ensuring revenues reach the public treasury. Meanwhile, the regional government demands that salaries be disbursed without any preconditions, as this is a legal entitlement for its employees.",Energy

@gaib_ai is turning that oil into a liquid market you can actually trade.

What is GAIB?
A financial layer for AI compute.

Although it's RWA but different from @plumenetwork because it takes GPUs, the engines powering AI and turns them into on-chain assets.

Instead of sitting in data centers, these machines become productive capital anyone can access.

How it works:

▪️GAIB has created AID, a synthetic dollar that is backed by the yield from AI computing resources.

▪️You can stake AID into sAID and earn some yield without losing liquidity.

▪️Data centers and providers can use GPUs to get some funds through GAIB.

Everything ties back to DeFi: lending, borrowing, and yield strategies.

Why does it matter?

Compute is scarce, expensive, and controlled by a handful of giants but GAIB opens that market that:

▪️Investors get access to compute yields

▪️Providers get financing to expand infrastructure

▪️DeFi gains a new class of real-world assets tied to AI growth

What makes Gaib unique? 

▪️GPUs tokenized as financial assets

▪️A synthetic dollar (AID) tied to real yield

▪️DeFi strategies built directly on compute

▪️Expansion into robotics and embodied AI, making even machines financially liquid

This is not simply another AI token following the trend.

It is a new financial engine for what is arguably the most valuable resource of this era: computing power.",Energy

🔥The recent agreement between the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and Baghdad on the resumption of oil exports
Under the deal, the Kurdistan Region will supply its daily oil production to Iraq. In return, Baghdad is obliged to allocate one trillion Iraqi dinars to the Kurdistan Region.
Clickbaiters told you over an over it's delay was for a new rate: total BS

The delay was because Baghdadi and Kurdistan have have different models for contracts with international oil companies (IOCs)
1. Federal Gov. is a Service Contracts model for IOCs
Government hires (pays the money upfront) to IOCs as contractors to explore, develop, and produce oil. IOCs are paid a fixed fee plus a share of production for their services.

2. KRG is a Production Sharing Contracts  Model
IOCs act as partners, funding all exploration and development risks. They receive a share of the produced oil (after cost recovery) as profit, with the government taking the remainder.

The Fed Gov. service contracts prioritize government control   while KRG PSCs Production Sharing Contracts  Model with no state outlay upfront and profit sharing. 
Baghdad pivot toward PSC-like elements (as in this deal) reflects necessity...its liquidity crunch makes the KRG's model more viable, 

💫To read full Article

The recent agreement between the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and Baghdad on the resumption of oil exports has been hailed as a landmark achievement for the Kurdistan Region, with potential ripple effects across Iraq’s energy policy, according to energy and oil contracts expert Dilshad Muwani,

Muwani emphasized that the deal represents not only an economic and political win for Erbil but also a structural shift in how Iraq manages its oil sector.

Key Provisions of the Agreement

Under the deal, the Kurdistan Region will supply its daily oil production to Iraq. In return, Baghdad is obliged to allocate one trillion Iraqi dinars to the Kurdistan Region.

Muwani stressed that this arrangement strengthens the KRG’s position:

“The Kurdistan Region is the major winner in this agreement. Iraq is effectively forced to provide budgetary support to the Region in exchange for access to its oil production.”

Baghdad’s Shift Toward Production Sharing

The agreement underscores Iraq’s worsening cash crisis, which has constrained its ability to sustain traditional oil service contracts. Under the service contract model, the Iraqi government pays upfront for exploration and production costs and later compensates companies with a portion of the extracted oil.

However, Muwani noted that Iraq no longer has the liquidity to maintain this system:

“Iraq does not have enough cash to invest in oil fields and drill new wells. It cannot pursue service contracts in which the government pays the cost of extraction and then rewards companies with oil.”

By contrast, the Kurdistan Region has long relied on Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs), in which foreign companies cover exploration and drilling costs in exchange for a negotiated share of production. This model suited the KRG in its early years, when it lacked robust oil infrastructure and sufficient investment capital.

Now, faced with a fiscal crunch, Baghdad appears to be shifting closer to the Kurdistan model.

“Due to its liquidity crisis, Iraq is forced to resort to production-sharing mechanisms. This reduces the financial burden on the federal government and encourages foreign companies to invest without Baghdad having to allocate large amounts of cash,” Muwani explained.

Implications for Iraq’s Energy Policy

Analysts argue that the agreement could mark a turning point for Iraq’s broader oil strategy. The deal not only ensures a steady flow of revenue for the Kurdistan Region but also signals Baghdad’s willingness to embrace new contractual models.

Muwani underlined the significance of this shift: “The agreement between the Kurdistan Region and Baghdad is not only an economic and political achievement for Erbil, but it will also reshape Iraq’s oil policy. Iraq’s move toward co-production contracts represents an important transformation that requires deeper research to assess its long-term impact.”

The alignment of federal oil policy with the KRG’s PSC framework could also pave the way for greater stability in investor relations, potentially making Iraq more attractive to international energy companies seeking predictable, profit-sharing arrangements.

The resumption of oil exports from the Kurdistan Region represents more than a budgetary lifeline. It underscores Baghdad’s growing reliance on the production-sharing model pioneered by the KRG, driven by its own financial crisis. If managed wisely, this shift could stabilize Iraq’s energy sector, attract foreign investment, and redefine federal-regional relations in the oil industry.

Still, the long-term implications—both political and economic—remain uncertain. As Muwani concludes, the agreement “draws a new map for oil relations in Iraq” and requires careful policy planning to maximize benefits for both Baghdad and Erbil while ensuring regional energy stability.",Energy

The minister stressed that exports are most meaningful when based on local innovation and added value. “For years, we have relied on mineral sales and crude exports, but exports are only a source of pride when they create value and deliver innovation,” he said.

2025-09-20 19:14:27+00:00,"Barzani Signals Breakthrough on Oil Exports: A Turning Point for Iraq and Kurdistan

At the inauguration of the Sheikhan–Lalish road project in Duhok, Kurdistan Region Prime Minister Masrour Barzani delivered a statement that could redefine Iraq’s energy map. He confirmed that the federal government in Baghdad and International Oil Companies (IOCs) operating in the Region have reached a broad understanding—one that may soon unlock the long-stalled resumption of Kurdish oil exports.

Geopolitical Context
For 18 months, Kurdish crude has been absent from international markets after exports through Turkey’s Ceyhan pipeline were suspended in March 2023. The freeze has drained more than \$30 billion from Iraq and the Kurdistan Region, tightening fiscal space, reducing investment flows, and weakening confidence in the country’s oil sector. The new understanding marks a step toward reconciling Iraq’s competing power centers: Baghdad’s federal control and Erbil’s autonomous energy policy. If implemented, it would not only restore vital revenues but also stabilize relations with Ankara, which has been eager to see the pipeline reopened under a clear legal framework.

Banking and Fiscal Dimensions
Beyond oil, Barzani underscored Erbil’s cooperation with Baghdad on budget and salary disputes, stressing that “no obstacles have ever been created” from Kurdistan’s side. A July deal already set terms: Erbil agreed to transfer 230,000 barrels per day to SOMO and remit 120 billion Iraqi dinars in non-oil revenues, in return for federal salary disbursements. Yet delays persist—civil servants only received June salaries in September, while July and August remain unpaid. Such gaps undermine public trust and highlight the urgent need for more predictable federal transfers and financial discipline.

Currency and Economic Outlook
Should oil exports resume, Iraq’s macroeconomic landscape could shift significantly. Restoring over 400,000 barrels per day from the Kurdistan Region would inject billions in foreign exchange into Iraq’s reserves, strengthen the Central Bank of Iraq’s ability to defend the dinar, and relieve pressure on the parallel market. Internationally, investors would interpret the breakthrough as a sign of political maturity and institutional coherence, potentially accelerating Iraq’s bid for greater global financial integration, including WTO accession and deeper ties with IFIs.

Outlook
Barzani’s remarks signal more than a technical oil deal—they represent a potential reset of Baghdad–Erbil relations. If Baghdad delivers on salary payments and IOCs receive payment guarantees, the long-awaited flow of Kurdish oil could resume within weeks. This would send a powerful message: Iraq is ready to move past old disputes and harness its full energy potential for national stability and regional influence. For the Kurdistan Region, it would mean fiscal breathing room and renewed faith in partnership with Baghdad. For Iraq as a whole, it would mean reclaiming lost revenues, strengthening its currency base, and demonstrating to global markets that cooperation, not fragmentation, defines its future.

Maharashtra’s power sector is moving ahead with clear priorities - expand solar energy, reduce tariffs, and upgrade grids.

Why this matters
- Solar expansion: Clean energy means less pollution, more self-reliance, and cheaper long-term costs.
- Tariff cuts: Relief for families and industries, making electricity more affordable.
- Grid improvements: Stronger infrastructure ensures fewer outages and smoother supply, even in peak demand.

The bigger picture
Energy is not just about lights and fans - it powers industries, jobs, and daily life. By combining green energy with fair pricing and modern systems, Maharashtra is building a future where power is both sustainable and reliable.

Credit to vision
These moves reflect leadership that thinks ahead. Under @Dev_Fadnavis (Deva Bhau), the state has placed clean energy and consumer relief at the core of its power policy. His push ensures progress is not only about supply, but also about affordability and long-term security.

2025-09-21 05:21:14+00:00,"Krasnov-Trump cannot copy the RU-economy 

1. Russia’s stance

Russia has little incentive to push renewables. Its economy is tied to oil, gas, coal, uranium exports.

So Moscow tends to block, ridicule, or underfund solar, wind, hydrogen—anything that threatens fossil rents.

Instead, Russia talks up “nuclear pride” and keeps energy policy centralized.

2. Trump’s stance

He isn’t against energy tech in principle, but he treats solar/wind/hydrogen as “losers” compared to oil, gas, coal.

Example: Trump often mocks wind (“kills birds, noisy, too expensive”), downplays solar, and puts tariffs on imported solar panels.

He favors fossil dominance + protectionist tariffs, which echoes the Russian way of guarding incumbents, not innovating.

3. The big difference

The U.S. has a strong private sector in renewables—Silicon Valley, Tesla, hydrogen startups, etc.—and they thrive globally even when the White House resists.

Russia doesn’t have that open innovation engine.

So Trump’s policies tilt the field against renewables, but the market forces and states (California, Texas wind, etc.) still keep them alive.

So yes: Trump does lean Russia’s way—protecting fossil rents, ridiculing green tech, and throwing tariffs around.

2025-09-21 17:39:05+00:00,"The UAE and Colombian Mercenaries in Sudan’s War: Oil Money Fueling a Trade in Blood

Middle East Eye published a report titled “From Sudan to Ukraine: Why Colombian mercenaries keep fighting foreign wars” by journalist Iñigo Alexander, exposing the central role of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in recruiting and financing Colombian mercenaries to fight alongside the Rapid Support Militia (Janjaweed) against the Sudanese Armed Forces.

According to the report, Sudanese military authorities submitted a formal letter to the UN Security Council stating that they had collected “extensive evidence” of “a systematic campaign by the UAE to undermine peace, security, and the sovereignty of Sudan, through the recruitment, financing, and deployment of mercenaries fighting alongside the Rapid Support Militia (Janjaweed).” While Khartoum presented these findings, Abu Dhabi flatly denied the allegations.

The recruitment process, as the investigation reveals, was orchestrated through a Colombian private security firm contracted by an Emirati company called Global Security Services Group. These mercenaries were deployed to fight within a battalion known as the “Desert Wolves,” commanded by a retired Colombian general based in Dubai — evidence that the operational hub of this network is managed from within the UAE itself.

The routes used to move the mercenaries to Sudan were not improvised but carefully structured. Initially, mercenaries traveled from Abu Dhabi to Benghazi in Libya, where their passports were confiscated to prevent them from returning home. As this pathway became widely known, the UAE facilitated alternative routes through Madrid, Ethiopia, and the Somali port city of Bosaso, then onward to N’Djamena in Chad, before finally arriving in Nyala, a city under Janjaweed control in Darfur.

Testimonies from the mercenaries themselves highlight the grim reality of this system. One Colombian soldier said in an audio recording: “Things are ugly here, we’re being held captive.” Another described it bluntly: “This is human trafficking. They hire us for one thing, and then take us somewhere else to do something different.” These accounts expose the exploitative nature of a network overseen and financed by Abu Dhabi.

Professor Sean McFate of the U.S. National Defense University noted that Colombians are considered “excellent fighters with a lot of combat experience and strong discipline,” and at the same time “cost a quarter of what an American mercenary would cost.” He added: “The UAE is a huge consumer of mercenary services. They have the money, they have the geopolitical ambitions to dominate the Middle East and parts of North Africa. There is demand from the Janjaweed, money from the UAE, and supply from Colombia.”

The report concludes that the UAE is not merely a secondary supporter but an active player fueling Sudan’s war through its vast oil wealth, turning former Colombian soldiers into a cheap commodity in the marketplace of conflict. This role not only escalates Sudan’s suffering but also undermines prospects for peace and shields perpetrators from accountability, as the use of mercenaries allows state actors like Abu Dhabi to wage proxy wars behind a cloak of plausible deniability.

2025-09-22 14:05:31+00:00,"🔥Boom! KRG, Baghdad, Oil Firms Sign Deal to Resume Kurdistan Oil Exports💥

ERBIL – The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), Iraq’s Ministry of Oil, and oil-producing companies have signed a trilateral agreement to resume oil exports from the Kurdistan Region, BasNews has learned.

The agreement, signed Monday afternoon in Erbil, clears the way for the re-export of Kurdish crude through Turkey’s Ceyhan port after more than two years of suspension. 

The deal is expected to be formally announced by Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani at Tuesday’s Iraqi Council of Ministers meeting, where further details will be released.

Earlier in the day, a technical delegation from Iraq’s state-run North Oil Company visited Erbil to finalize export procedures. The delegation held a four-hour meeting with the KRG’s Ministry of Natural Resources, paving the way for the deal’s conclusion.

Under the agreement, the Kurdistan Region will hand over 230,000 barrels of crude per day to the State Organization for Marketing of Oil (SOMO), while retaining 50,000 barrels for domestic consumption. Exports will flow to Ceyhan via the North Oil Company.

KRG spokesperson Peshawa Hawramani had told BasNews on Monday that such a deal was imminent, stressing that it would remove obstacles to the transfer of federal salaries to Kurdistan Region employees.

Oil exports from the Kurdistan Region through Ceyhan were halted in March 2023 following a ruling by the International Chamber of Commerce’s Court of Arbitration in Paris.

The court found that Turkey had violated a 1973 pipeline agreement by allowing Erbil to independently export crude without Baghdad’s consent between 2014 and 2018, ordering Ankara to pay $1.5 billion in damages to Iraq.

Although Turkey has appealed the ruling, it has signaled readiness to reopen the pipeline once Baghdad and Erbil reach an internal settlement. The suspension has cost the KRG billions of dollars in revenue and deepened its reliance on federal budget transfers to cover public sector salaries.

The resumption of exports is seen as a breakthrough for both Erbil and Baghdad, potentially easing long-standing disputes over oil and revenue sharing while reassuring international oil companies invested in the Kurdistan Region.",Energy

The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) expressed its satisfaction with reaching a trilateral agreement to resume oil exports from the Kurdistan Region. The government emphasized that this step could strengthen financial stability and help resolve the salary crisis affecting public employees in the region.

Summary of the Agreement

The agreement consists of six main and preliminary articles and was formally signed by Iraq’s Ministry of Oil, the KRG’s Ministry of Natural Resources, and participating oil companies. It clearly outlines the rights, obligations, and commitments of all three parties involved.

Resumption of Oil Exports

It has been decided that at exactly 6:00 AM on Saturday, September 27, 2025, oil from the Kurdistan Region will once again flow through the Kurdistan–Ceyhan pipeline to international markets.

Financial and Marketing Mechanism

Under the new agreement, Iraq’s State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO) will take responsibility for marketing Kurdistan’s oil. The revenue from oil sales will be transferred to the federal treasury in Baghdad. Simultaneously, non-oil revenues from the Kurdistan Region will also be deposited into the federal treasury. This arrangement ensures that the Kurdistan Region contributes to Iraq’s overall revenue growth.

KRG: Ending the Salary Crisis

According to the KRG’s official statement, the primary goal of this agreement is to resolve the salary crisis and ensure financial fairness for the Kurdistan Region. The government expressed hope that the deal would lead to consistent salary payments and end the uncertainty faced by public employees. It stressed the importance of separating salary issues from political disputes. Revenues will be allocated within the framework of Iraq’s national budget to cover the Region’s salary and financial entitlements.",Energy

Chinese electric vehicle (EV) stocks NIO (NYSE: NIO) and Li Auto (NASDAQ: LI) slipped Friday following news that Beijing plans to implement stricter regulations on EV exports. Starting January 1, China’s Ministry of Commerce will require automakers to secure permits before exporting EVs, a measure officials say is intended to ensure the “healthy development” of the EV industry. Despite the regulatory challenges, Chinese EV stocks have posted strong gains in 2024. Exports have become a key growth driver for Chinese manufacturers, with Europe being a significant market.

Unlike studies that focus narrowly on trade volume or rely on growth models with assumptions ill-suited for low-income economies, his research highlights the importance of aligning factor-intensive trade with connectivity modes. Using a dual framework—a modified Jones (1996) semi-endogenous model and an augmented Solow model—it shows that growth in ASEAN depends not on openness alone but on the interaction of trade, infrastructure, and renewable energy. The findings are especially striking for countries like Lao PDR, where renewable energy intensity and human capital amplify the growth effects of capital-intensive trade when supported by efficient transport systems.

The muscle of the robots comes from raw materials giving robots strength.

This is often overlooked and consists of metals, magnets, and batteries providing power and motion to robots. 

Think about how smooth a robot has to be to do precision surgery on a human being. That is because of magnets. 

These come from rare earth elements that must be mined and are currently scarce because of how long mines can take to create. You need lightweight neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets for robots.

With demand surging for robots, you need about 2 - 4 pounds of rare-earth magnets per humanoid and the scale is expected to be able to produce billions of robots by 2050.

You need supply chain security and China is dominating this space right now. US firms are building domestic capabilities, but a huge risk to the US and advancement is the fact that China is dominating this right now.

I think you’re going to see public companies come out of nowhere and get mass government funding because the US is scared to fall behind.

In comes MP Materials - a US rare earth mine and magnet plant. It supplies Tesla, GM, and the Pentagon covering 15% of global output. They’re the leader in the US for sure and a great play to own long term.

Demand has soared for rare earth materials, owning companies like $MP is important for your portfolio because the materials will get cheaper and cheaper to produce, but demand is skyrocketing allowing unlimited inflation in the cost to buy those materials.

One big challenge to overcome, beyond cost, is that batteries may only last 2-4 hours per charge. There needs to be more innovation here to overcome this limitation.",Energy

2025-09-27 15:09:09+00:00,"The $TSLA breakout is a good lesson in what to look for if you want to swing big.

Let’s start with the technicals of this trade.

We see that the stock suffered a major decline, bottomed in April around $220, pushed to $350, then spent over four months consolidating between $300 and $350. This is a textbook pattern, a big decline, big advance off a low, followed by a long consolidation.

This allowed all key moving averages to tighten on the daily and weekly timeframe.

The most important technical aspect of this trade is the volatility contraction. May to September volatility slowly decreased and price action tightened. If you start in May, the pullbacks got less severe as the base progressed. 

From the peak in May to the breakout in September, the declines were: -26%, -20%, -13%, -10%, -9%.

This is textbook, less sellers continued to show up as the base progressed. From contraction comes expansion.

The narrative and fundamental aspect of the trade is what juiced it further.

Tesla has bet its entire future on AI. While other big tech names only had AI as part of their business, Tesla was betting the company on it. The AI trade is progressing, people are looking for who can actually apply AI to physical products. Robotics and autonomous driving are the pinnacle of AI and Tesla was already seen as the face of both. The Robotaxi app wide release also came just days before the breakout.

The macro backdrop had turned supportive. Rate cut talk picked up after Jackson Hole and lower borrowing costs means easier car financing for consumers and more enterprise investment into Tesla energy.

Earnings have been poor which means earnings comps going forward are extremely low after many weak quarters. That sets the stage for even EPS and revenue growth to flip the narrative. The market is forward looking.

There is also a major shift in sentiment around Elon. He’s stepped back from politics and referred to it as a side quest in his past. That showed his commitment to Tesla which had been in question for over a year.

The biggest piece was his new compensation package which tied his $ directly to autonomy, robotics, and FSD adoption. The milestones are astronomical which aligned his incentives with shareholders.

If you missed this trade don’t sweat it, just know these opportunities present themselves over and over again so try and be ready next time. The best trades have much more than a nice chart, all of the stars aligned.",Energy

So now, Muslims has with their 59 countries at least 50% of the UN votes that will never vote against them, and that’s why you will never see resolution and condemnation against Islamic countries even that they don’t have Human rights, woman rights, they own slaves and execute whoever they want, they persecute Christians and other minorities and they train and funds dozen Islamic terror organizations

Speaking to Sputnik India, Lavrov said this stance reflects India’s national interest, pride, and honor. He criticized the US assumption that India would negotiate oil purchases on American terms as flawed. 

Lavrov reiterated that all trade discussions are strictly bilateral matters between Russia and India. His comments come amid ongoing US efforts to dissuade New Delhi from buying Russian crude oil, highlighting the close and independent nature of India-Russia relations in the energy sector.

- trying to force India off Russian oil w tariffs
- getting Pfizer (and probably others to follow) to cave on drug prices threatening tariffs (that’s huge)
- making a visible effort at peace in the middle east (and achieving quite a bit w Abraham accords already!)
- being honest about the way he thought his Russia-Ukraine effort would go and acknowledging it did not work
- reducing illegal border crossings to almost zero
- pointing the finger at absurd European laws in UK and Germany (among others) that outlaw insulting politicians (yes, that is a free speech problem)
- installing the smartest Treasury Secretary the US has ever had
- supporting AI and Crypto industries to power innovation
- trying to bring Jobs home (won’t work, he’ll just drive talent away)
- being hyperactive and working his butt off despite all the Golfing

The price is him attacking his (perceived) enemies using the resources of the state, like a true dictator, the world losing a generally benign policeman (because it s pretty clear human rights in Saudi, China or North Korea are now irrelevant) and companies and news organizations kowtowing to “Dear Leader”.

Also there is an unmentionably high price we will all pay when E Warren or AOC get elected president and use the same exact playbook to destroy the economy.

2025-09-30 22:36:19+00:00,"1. Venezuela’s Oil Wealth

Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, even more than Saudi Arabia.

Oil makes up about 95% of Venezuela’s exports and is the backbone of its economy.

2. U.S. Sanctions & Economic Collapse

In the 2010s, the U.S. imposed heavy sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry (especially on state oil company PDVSA).

These sanctions were meant to pressure Nicolás Maduro’s government.

The result: Venezuela was cut off from the U.S. financial system, couldn’t sell oil freely, and its currency collapsed.

This triggered hyperinflation, with basic goods costing millions of bolívars.

3. China Steps In

While the U.S. tried to choke Venezuela economically, China and Russia stepped in as lifelines.

China has loan-for-oil deals with Venezuela, meaning Venezuela sends crude in exchange for Chinese financing.

In recent years, China buys much of Venezuela’s sanctioned oil at a discount, rerouting it through middlemen or blending it to hide its origin.

4. Why the U.S. Wants It

The U.S. still wants access to Venezuelan oil because:

It’s close geographically (cheap transport compared to Middle East).

It could help stabilize oil prices and reduce dependence on OPEC and hostile states.

American refineries are built to process Venezuela’s heavy crude.

5. The Big Picture

Venezuela’s crisis wasn’t just from “bad socialism” or “mismanagement” — U.S. sanctions crushed its ability to sell oil legally.

China filled the gap, securing cheap energy while building political influence in Latin America.

Now the U.S. is reconsidering its stance, since blocking Venezuela only pushed it deeper into China’s orbit.",Energy
