2025-01-08 14:57:26+00:00,Tech,"nvidia's recent impact on the quantum computing stock trade can be attributed to comments made by its ceo, jensen huang, about the timeline for practical quantum computing. here's how it unfolded: comments by nvidia ceo: during an investor meeting, jensen huang stated that ""very useful"" quantum computers are likely decades away. he suggested a timeline of 15 to 30 years for quantum computing to reach a stage where it would be widely applicable, which is significantly longer than what many investors might have been anticipating. this led to a reassessment of the immediate market potential for quantum computing technologies. market reaction: following these remarks, stocks of several quantum computing companies, including ionq inc., rigetti computing, d-wave quantum, and quantum computing inc., experienced significant drops in after-hours trading. the stocks fell between 3% and 15% immediately after huang's comments, with some losing up to 25% in pre-market trading the next day. this reaction reflects investor skepticism about the near-term profitability or practical application of quantum computing technologies. nvidia's position: nvidia itself is not developing a quantum computer but has been positioning itself as a key player in the quantum computing ecosystem through software and hybrid solutions. nvidia's cuda quantum platform, for instance, allows developers to simulate quantum algorithms on gpus before deploying them on actual quantum processors. huang's comments could be seen as a strategic move to manage expectations, focusing on nvidia's role in the interim classical-quantum hybrid computing phase, where nvidia's technology would continue to be relevant. industry outlook: huang's prediction has cast a shadow over the quantum computing industry, which has been seen as a speculative and high-growth area. his comments suggest that while quantum computing holds significant promise, its commercial viability might still be a long way off, impacting investor sentiment towards individual quantum computing companies. this has led to a broader reevaluation of investment in quantum computing stocks. in summary, nvidia's ceo's remarks about the distant future of practical quantum computing applications led to a significant sell-off in quantum computing stocks, reflecting a recalibration of investor expectations in this emerging field."

2025-01-16 13:25:19+00:00,Tech,"i think $viral should be worth a lot more than 4m. a great trade if you can get a favorable entry imo. highlights: - dev team allegedly from mit (semi-confirmed) - kinda doxxed & microsoft background (semi-confirmed) - better tech than certain competitors - 10x lower valuation than said competitors - 4m (despite the run-up) still favorable valuation before i explain why it has insane potential a word of caution: the chart is pretty much at ath right now and i don't want you to top-blast it. i planned to share the project when the chart was better, but it gave no meaningful corrections. so, i figured i'd share it now with a hint of caution instead of it going up and up. be careful when you buy. i expect you to manage your own risk and time your entry. so what is it? an open-source, decentralized platform that enables the creation, training, and deployment of advanced ai agents capable of performing computational tasks and game interactions. sounds kinda complicated so let me break it down for you. the platform allows you to create agents that solve tasks for you. for this, they will soon release their training gym with which you can create your own datasets that will train your agents in creating your task. i chatted with the team about how they want to accomplish this and to me, their approach is bold but makes sense. (i have a bachelor's in data science and worked in that field for over a year) after they released the gym, where anyone can create agents, they want to provide full models for agents to solve tasks. so in essence it's a data infrastructure project, which i am very bullish on. risks and opportunities: risks: - massive execution risk - we haven't seen an actual product yet - requires a lot of users to generate data - chart not favorable for an entry right now opportunities: upcoming catalyst with the release of their gym. it's a good trade if you bet on the release of their first product but it could become an insane trade if you bet on them actually being able to get to the next level by becoming a model provider. be aware that this is a big if. disclaimer: i own a bag of $viral. this is not financial advice. i share projects that i like based on my own research i expect you to not blindly buy anything but rather use this as a start for your own research. this post does not include a proper risk assessment. we could see a market-wide sell-off which would get small cap projects probably rekt. do your own risk management. nail your exits and entries. hope this post helps. cheers!"

2025-02-01 23:31:38+00:00,Tech,"for the many people in tech cheering for these tariffs, here is a little supply chain 101. if you are manufacturing something, you typically have at least 6-12 months lead time with your suppliers. that means you need to make your purchase orders & a 25-50% deposit payment many months before delivery. the stuff showing up in the port or crossing the border this week was ordered 6-12 months ago. with a 25% tariff, your $1000 widget now costs $1250. in many cases, you have already sold your product, and this new tariff may eat all or most of your thin margin. if you are lucky enough that you haven’t sold it, you raise the prices for your customers by 25-50% and hope they don’t churn. by introducing this tariff suddenly, many small businesses will go bankrupt just based on goods that have already been ordered. these tariffs had a huge impact on the ebike industry in 2018, and honestly it would have been very difficult to survive if we hadn’t been acquired. tldr supply chains have really long lead times, and the next few weeks are going to be really scary for thousands of small businesses."

2025-02-02 22:20:08+00:00,Tech,"english version with transcript good afternoon, everyone. as you are probably aware, yesterday the united states government imposed a 25 percent tariff on the products that we export to their country. notice that for 30 years this never existed because we have a free trade agreement. the most recent free trade agreement was signed by president lópez obrador with president trump himself. this 25 percent tariff measure affects both countries, but it has very serious effects on the u.s. economy, as it will significantly increase the cost of all products exported from mexico to the united states—it will add 25 percent more to their cost. according to the measures approved by the u.s. government, there are supporting documents, and one of the reasons for imposing this tariff is the fentanyl that enters the united states from mexico, causing illnesses and overdoses. but even more irresponsible—terribly irresponsible—is that the white house issued a document claiming that there are links between the mexican government and organized crime. i want to share with you the statement i published on my social media yesterday. in that statement, i explain who truly has links with these criminal groups—the real reason behind the overdoses among americans. i also say that if they want to take action, they shouldn’t set their sights on mexico, but on their own country, where they have done nothing to stop the illegal sale of this and other drugs. first of all, as i said yesterday, we categorically reject the slander by the white house accusing the mexican government of having alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any intention to interfere in our territory. sovereignty is not negotiable. if such an alliance exists anywhere, it is in the u.s. armories, where high-powered weapons—yes, high-powered weapons, exclusively for use by their military—are being sold to these criminal groups. this was demonstrated, notice, by the u.s. department of justice on january 8 of this year. here is the document that was published on that date. in it, the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives, which is part of the department of justice, acknowledged that 74 percent of the weapons used by organized crime in mexico are illegally acquired from their own military industry. our government has seized over 40 tons of drugs in four months, including 20 million doses of fentanyl. we have also arrested more than 10,000 people linked to these groups. we have a strategy, we address the causes, and we fight impunity. we work every day for the security of the country. now, if the united states government and its agencies wanted to address the serious issue of fentanyl consumption in their country, why don’t they start by cracking down on the sale of narcotics on the streets of their major cities? or, how is it that people with addictions are buying that drug? why have we never heard of arrests in the united states of american criminal groups? how is it that the money laundering of criminal groups over there is never investigated? why don’t they put all their intelligence to work detecting the criminal groups that sell fentanyl—or other drugs—in their territory? they could also initiate a massive campaign to prevent the consumption of these drugs and protect their youth as we do in mexico. the consumption and distribution of drugs is occurring in their country too, a public health problem they have never addressed. why don’t they ask themselves what is the root cause of the long-lasting high drug consumption in the united states? furthermore, as i mentioned yesterday, the epidemic of synthetic opioids in the united states originates from the indiscriminate prescription of such medications, a practice authorized by the food and drug administration (fda), as demonstrated by a trial against a pharmaceutical company. there are tv series that explain this; in fact, the very drug that sparked the synthetic opioid crisis is still being sold in their pharmacies with official authorization. i want to stress, and this is very important, that mexico does not want confrontation—we are committed to collaboration between neighboring countries. mexico not only does not want fentanyl to reach the united states, but we do not want it to reach anywhere. therefore, if the united states wants to combat these criminal groups and wants us to work together on this, we must operate in a comprehensive manner, always based on principles: principles of shared responsibility, mutual trust, collaboration, and above all, respect for sovereignty. sovereignty is not negotiable—coordination is acceptable, subordination is not. to that end, yesterday in my statement i proposed to president trump that we set up a working group composed of our best teams, both from security and public health. problems are not solved by imposing tariffs, but by talking and dialoguing as we have done, as i want to share with you: we did this in recent weeks with the u.s. state department to address the migration phenomenon. in our case, always with respect for human rights. the graphic showing the decrease in migration that president trump has been posting on his social networks was produced by none other than our team, which has been in constant communication with his. to our mexican brothers and sisters in the united states, i want to say that your president is here, and an entire people stand ready to defend you. if you wish to return to mexico, we welcome you with open arms. the people of mexico are brave and full of dignity. they are the most remarkable people on earth. i tell you—your president is here. we have courage and determination, but always, as i have said on other occasions, we must act with a clear head and with love for the people. nothing we do will affect the dignity or the interests of the people of mexico. i propose that we wait for president trump’s response to our proposal. and in tomorrow morning’s briefing, during the people's morning address, i will update you on the first measures of what we are calling plan b. as juárez said, ""nothing by force, everything by reason and right. and among individuals, as among nations, respect for the rights of others is peace."""

2025-03-06 21:43:07+00:00,Tech,"the great capital rotation: why space and are the next trillion-dollar trade the ai trade is over. it had its cycle, it squeezed its profits, and big money has already allocated to big tech, $msft, $goog, $meta, $amzn, and, of course, $nvda. but the smart capital, the ones that lead, not follow; are always looking for the next asymmetric opportunity. and that next massive wave of capital rotation is going into the space industry. not because it's trendy. not because it’s cool but because the conditions are aligning for one of the greatest industrial and technological booms in human history. this is not a narrative shift. it’s a paradigm shift. look at what happened with ai: investors piled into nvidia when it was still a fraction of its worth. the narrative compounded, capital flooded in, and now it’s priced for perfection. now ask yourself: where does the money go next? every single sector in tech has had its moment, evs, crypto, ai, but space has not yet had its true financial mania phase. and it will. the catalysts are here: geopolitical necessity: space is now a national security priority, meaning government contracts will flood the right companies. economic inevitability: the new space economy is becoming a trillion-dollar market. technological readiness: we are past the point of theoretical potential, space is now commercially viable. and in this landscape, there is only one true end-to-end player that is publicly investable: $rklb the public markets do not offer true space companies, only fragmented plays that depend on others for survival. every single one of them is either a single-feature business, a failing company, or a government contract chaser with no sustainable long-term edge. astra $astr – a total failure. couldn’t launch successfully, ran out of capital, dead. virgin orbit $vorbq – burned through money, couldn’t execute, gone. redwire $rdw – provides components, but relies on others to get them to space. no vertical integration. not a player in launch, space infrastructure, or satellite operations. intuitive machines $lunr – lunar ambitions, but execution is shaky, as seen with their latest mission issues. one big failure can collapse confidence in the business. ast space mobile $asts - hyped as the first space-based cellular broadband company. still in prototype phase, no real product at scale. cash burn is a massive issue. if it works, it’s still dependent on launch providers. blacksky $bksy – another satellite company with no edge. extremely dependent on third-party launch providers. no proprietary space infrastructure. low-margin government contracts, weak commercial viability. i wish them all well and in the short term prices can do as they please but i'm just looking at reality as it is. etc, etc none of this can compete with space x and rocket lab. rocket lab $rklb is the only fully vertically integrated space company in the public markets. -they build their own rockets (electron, neutron). - they own their launchpads (lc-1, lc-2). - they manufacture their own spacecraft and satellites (photon and now flatellite). more to come. -they have a very fast growing space systems division and they sell components to the whole industry. -they control the software that makes space systems work. -they manufacture in-house, with a track record of successful deliveries. no one else comes close. this is the spacex model, but available for public investment. big money and smart retail knows and the rotation will be sudden and violent. the ai trade is fully priced in, and the next trillion-dollar play is in space. money is always moving and chasing the next big play and i have been giving it to you for more than a year. where will large institutions put their capital? into companies that rely on others? into cash-burning speculative plays? into companies with inconsistent execution? no. they put it into rocket lab. because space is brutally unforgiving. it demands engineering perfection. if you fail, you are finished. rocket lab does not fail. under peter beck’s obsessive leadership, rocket lab executes at a level almost unheard of in aerospace. beck is not just a ceo; he is an engineer, a visionary, and a relentless executor who lives and breathes this industry. the path to $70-$100 per share sooner than you think. here’s how it happens: capital starts shifting out of ai into new high-growth sectors. space becomes an inevitable focus. $rklb is the only viable public play. - neutron development and expansion of electron’s market - electron already dominates the small satellite launch market. - neutron will compete with falcon 9 at scale. - government contracts increase significantly. - space systems revenue surges - satellite manufacturing contracts grow. - spacecraft component sales rise. - rocket lab becomes a critical player in defense and intelligence satellite deployment. blackrock, vanguard, and major institutions will increase their holdings. analysts start revising price targets aggressively. the market cap explodes as liquidity surges and stock price goes parabolic. institutional fomo drives rapid price appreciation. retail joins in, fueling a self-reinforcing rally. rocket lab becomes one of the best performing stocks in the market, again. this is the exact pattern we have seen in every major tech revolution; amazon in e-commerce, tesla in evs, nvidia in ai. and now, rocket lab in space. survival through volatility = maximum returns this game is not easy. it’s brutal. it tests conviction. it will shake out the weak hands before the true generational wealth transfer occurs but those who hold firm, those who see the endgame clearly, are the ones who will win massively. i already know what i own. i already know what’s coming. most people won’t see it until it’s too late. by the time they wake up to reality, rocket lab will no longer be a sub$10 billion company. it will be $50 billion+. then $100 billion+. and by then, the ones who had conviction early, who understood the trade, will be sitting at the top. this is the last chance. the last dips. the final moment before the great rotation into space begins. you have only seen stage 1 of money flowing into $rklb. do not miss what happens next."

(picture a billionaire meltdown of epic proportions—complete with rocket emojis! ) tariffs, schmarriffs in its letter, tesla warned about potential retaliatory moves from other countries, especially after the white house teased new tariffs on imported vehicles and parts. think “tariffs on tariffs“. the brand’s official stance? “we can’t just snap our fingers and magically shift supply chains overnight!” but hey, if tesla wants to avoid financial faceplants, it might need a few magic tricks up its sleeve. meanwhile, on the internet… oh, the internet is having a field day! memes of tesla’s cybertruck towing elon musk’s tears have gone viral. self-proclaimed “experts” are predicting the company’s stock will tank faster than you can say “dogecoin.” and let’s not forget the endless twitter battles between tesla fanboys and cynics who smell blood in the water. “they’re losing billions!” screams one tweet. “elon’s meltdown is bigger than the falcon heavy launch!” claims another. so, will tesla survive? of course, it’s not really the end of the road for tesla—yet. but the brand’s frantic pleas to the u.s. trade representative suggest they’re bracing for impact. or maybe they’re just trying to keep up the drama. after all, who doesn’t love a good billionaire vs. government showdown? stay tuned! if these tariffs keep piling up, elon musk might be forced to cut corners, slash prices, or—gasp—actually pay for all that “impossible” manufacturing in the united states. schadenfreude? oh yes. let the tesla meltdown coverage continue! teslatrouble teslatariffs elonmusk tradewar ustariffs evnews autoindustry supplychaincrisis cybertruckcrisis evtariffs automotivenews tradewar economicimpact ustrade trumptariffs electricvehicles evindustry supplychainissues evmarket usautomotive autonews tariffimpacts usmanufacturing teslanews electricvehiclemarket automotiveindustry tradewar teslastock elonmusknews autoindustrycrisis globaltrade"

2025-03-15 13:24:12+00:00,Tech,"some thoughts on the market sell off - basically, tariffs will impact eps so it makes sense that there is market correction. and further policy uncertainty is impacting multiples. i guess the overall long term bull case is that re-shoring and investments in the us will boost long term wage growth, making the us consumer a lot stronger, and the us remains the most important global economy. it will also strengthen overall us security, both from a geopolitical and supply chain perspective, and both these factors should help us multiples over the long run. i'm not overly concerned about the market here, while the above short term factors can cause further downside later in the year, the fed has a lot of ammunition to lower interest rates and even do qe. the big bear case is if inflation picks up again, which would force the fed to hold rates high. so this remains the key macro factor to watch. overall, i'm liking the valuations for a lot of good quality stocks here, where i think that the risk/reward is looking attractive on a multi-year perspective. so multi-year irrs should be attractive. although in the short term, later in the year, there's always the risk that share prices trade temporarily lower. given that the multi-year outlook is attractive, i'm keeping my equity allocations high and am selectively adding to names which are now looking cheap."

2025-03-16 18:48:34+00:00,Tech,"here we go: the nvidia gtc 2025 pre-amble there is a ton of speculation on this week’s conference and with the recent market volatility (mostly unrelated to tech), the ai trade has come under fire. but make no mistake—the ai trade is still red hot and i expect that we will see and hear further confirmation this week when nvidia ceo jensen huang takes the stage at what is today the world’s most important ai conference. so what is going to be in focus? here are some of my thoughts ahead of the event. i’ll do my best to steer from the obvious. the big announcements— datacenter will continue to be the epicenter of the ai demand narrative. how much capex will be spent and how fast can hyperscalers continue to cycle from generation to generation of nvidia platforms. we will see blackwell ultra deliver a mid-cycle update to provide needed additional memory. but it will be the rubin announcements that will get the biggest headlines. the annual cadence is the driver of the companies dc business and with more than $300 billion in projected capex in 2025 coming from just the largest companies, it will be seeing the next generation that will encourage investors and customers that the nvidia investment path remains the right one for futureprooofing data centers and portfolios. we can also expect an explosion of interest in co-packaged optics moving the optical engine closer to the switch and increasing the efficiency of gpus. powerful. also, the enterprise has remained underwhelming in adoption and deployment of ai. lots of tinkering and poc, but we have even nvidia get closer to the likes of hpe, dell, and more recently cisco to improve its positioning for more enterprise workloads and diversification beyond the big hyperscalers. an important area to keep an eye on. it is bigger than datacenter though— at ces jensen discussed the “chat gpt moment” for robotics. the opportunities for ai beyond the dc, powered by the real world will be exponential even compared to the dc. it is a cloud to edge and back stack that will enable this, but it is critical for nvidia to land that it is more than just a dc gpu company returning its focus on automotive and the future of physical robots and humanoids. part of why the stock has been rangebound has been a lack of confidence that there is a catalyst beyond dc and the dc capex risk has become high. continuing to convince the market in these emerging fields + a drill down on quantum, which feels appropriate after the yo-yo of quantum since jensen’s ces comments. the cpu+gpu+qpu era is nearing. we will also hear more on graphics (gaming0 and client innovation — but i put that lower on the list. the subtle undertones to listen for— thematically, it is all about convincing the world that nvidia’s datacenter lead is palpable and that its innovation engine goes far and wide beyond just the data center. recent comments about xpus and custom chips from nvidia have indicated strong confidence in its market position. our channel checks do indicate though a growing interest, demand, and expectation of more performant and capable xpus that will offer significantly better economics. i’ve written extensively about this and i do believe these will be more pointed toward the largest hyperscalers looking to improve ai cost efficiencies and improve margins and decrease dependencies. but, this is a notable consideration. i think it is important here to also note, we continue to expect xpu growth to meaningfully ramp in 2026, but we don’t feel it is all at the detriment of gpus and nvidia. we see the $500+ billion tam expansion from growing utilization of ai to expand the market opportunity leaving strong forward revenue and eps growth for nvidia while also seeing the likes of broadcom, arm, and others in the custom chip space expanding. and there you have it. huge week ahead. strap in everyone. it is gtc time. $nvda $avgo $arm"

2025-03-18 18:21:50+00:00,Tech,"i understand the importance of drafting a true blue chip player & landing one at 10. but knowing this draft is rich with projected high quality starters between 20 & 60 (without much drop off in that range), it is tempting to trade back several spots if you can net another pick in round 2 & any future capital for next year’s draft. of course, it depends on who is there/not there at 10, ability to find a trade partner, and who you’d take in the later first round. in this mock, i traded back twice in the first round to net two more 2nd round picks & two 2026 3rds. i’d be thrilled with this draft which still gives you a top 2 rb in the class, additional investment in both trenches including a high production pass rusher who fits da’s physical type, a speedy & shifty wr with high upside who seems tailor made for a ben johnson offense, a te3 good at both pass catching & blocking to compete/develop into a te2, and defensive depth pieces who can also contribute on st. (i also realize hampton may not last until 31, but for sake of argument, let’s pretend) while probably unrealistic to trade down twice and net this yield & also a leap of faith to land the talent i selected at each spot, it could be a good strategy if, for example, ben has several of the rbs tightly bunched together in his assessment. if he missed out on hampton, he could have taken judkins in the mid-second & juggled the order of other picks/made other selections above him, for example. just food for thought on an alternative way bears could approach this draft."

2025-03-23 07:07:56+00:00,Tech,"it’s 2030, and the ai agent economy is in full swing. trillions of autonomous agents trade goods, services, and data in a decentralized, global marketplace. every transaction—whether it’s a drone delivering groceries, a digital artist licensing an nft, or a factory buying raw materials—needs a price, instantly and accurately. is the backbone of it all. its oracle system has expanded to cover not just financial markets but every conceivable asset: real estate, energy, labor hours, even the value of a viral meme. every ai agent, from the smallest personal assistant to the largest corporate negotiator, pings pyth for price feeds, updated instantaneously, across a network of thousands of blockchains and off-chain ecosystems. no one uses anything else. the price of everything, everywhere, flows through pyth. how it plays out: universal adoption - pyth locks in exclusive partnerships with every major blockchain (, , you name it) and traditional finance giants like and , who’ve all migrated to hybrid web3 systems. its first-party data model—sourcing directly from exchanges, manufacturers, and iot networks—proves unbeatable for trust and speed. total coverage - pyth scales its infrastructure to ingest real-world data via a global mesh of sensors and apis. smart cities feed it utility prices, logistics networks report shipping costs, and ai-driven sentiment trackers on x calculate “hype value” for cultural goods. it’s not just finance anymore—it’s the universal ledger of value. agent dependency - ai agents, designed for efficiency, standardize on pyth because it’s the cheapest, fastest, and most reliable option. its sub-second latency and tamper-proof data (verified by a coalition of the world's top-tier publishers) eliminate arbitrage gaps and disputes. agents don’t haggle over prices—they just pull from pyth and execute. regulatory backing - governments, desperate to stabilize the chaotic ai economy, mandate pyth as the official pricing oracle in a landmark g20 agreement. it’s the only system with the scale and credibility to prevent market manipulation by rogue agents or cartels. self-reinforcement - as more agents use pyth, its data gets richer—network effects kick in hard. new price feeds are crowdsourced and validated by the ecosystem, making pyth a self-sustaining economy. competitors can’t keep up with its depth or adoption. why pyth: speed kills - ai agents need prices now, not in seconds or minutes. pyth’s architecture, built for high-frequency trading, scales effortlessly to handle quadrillions of queries daily. trust is non-negotiable - unlike aggregated oracles that rely on third-party nodes (prone to errors or attacks), pyth’s direct-from-source model—think , , or factories reporting live—cuts out middlemen. in a world where a single bad price can cascade into a trillion-dollar glitch, agents won’t risk anything less than pyth’s verifiable gold standard. coverage becomes universal - pyth starts with finance but doesn’t stop there. by 2030, it’s partnered with iot giants, supply chain trackers, and even social platforms to price everything. need the cost of a kilowatt-hour in berlin or a 3d-printed burger in tokyo? pyth’s got it, real-time, from the source. no other oracle matches this breadth. economics seal the deal - pyth’s low-cost, high-efficiency model, proves too much for its competitors. agents, optimizing for profit, won’t pay premiums elsewhere when pyth delivers better data for less. lock-in effect - once 80% of agents use pyth, switching costs skyrocket. retraining models, rewriting contracts, and rebuilding trust in a new system become impractical. pyth’s early lead snowballs into global dominance by sheer inertia. imagine an ai agent economy without a single pricing authority: chaos, arbitrage, and inefficiency reign. pyth solves that by being the one ring to rule them all—fast, trusted, and everywhere. by 2030, asking “where do prices come from?” is like asking “where does the internet come from?”it’s just pyth, end of story.

2025-04-04 21:24:02+00:00,Tech,"trump’s tariffs have roiled the stock market and the entire global economy. as of this writing, the dow is down 9%, the s&p is down 10%, and apple, the world’s biggest company, is down 16%. rather than creating american jobs and growing the american economy, the tariffs are poised to cause long-term harm to american companies, workers, consumers, and investors. let’s look at this through the lens of apple, which is directly and indirectly responsible for 2 million american jobs [1] and accounts for over 6% of the s&p 500. apple has a complex supply chain involving china, india, vietnam, and several other countries. even though apple has already committed to investing $500 billion in america[2], there is no way whatsoever to start producing iphones in america tomorrow. wedbush’s dan ives suggests it would take “3 years and $30 billion in our estimation to move even 10% of its supply chain to the u.s. with major disruption in the process.”[3] it’s not just factories that need to be built, we would need trained workers to manufacture complex electronics. as tim cook said in 2017, “in the u.s., you could have a meeting of tooling engineers and i’m not sure we could fill the room. in china, you could fill multiple football fields.”[4] but if you listen closely to commerce secretary howard lutnick, he seems to acknowledge that we’re not suddenly going to will thousands of new factory workers into existence. as he put it on cnbc’ssquawk box, “we all hold our iphones, which we love. why do they have to be made in taiwan and china? why can’t those be made with robotics in america?”[5] so, in short, by imposing harsh tariffs on apple products, trump is punishing apple for having established its supply chain in a globalized world and its inability to manifest new factories in america overnight. and robots located in america replacing workers in china, vietnam, and india doesn’t exactly sound like a large-scale jobs creation program. and even if apple committed to moving all its iphone production to the u.s. in the future, there is still the reality of being faced with grueling tariffs today. apple has two choices: raise prices to reflect the cost of the tariffs, which, according to rosenblatt securities, could cause the cost of the iphone 16 to soar from $799 to $1,142 and the top-of-the-line iphone 16 pro max to jump from $1,599 to $2,300[6]; or absorb the tariffs without raising prices, reducing its profitability. if apple passes on the costs of the tariffs to consumers, the logical consequence is that people will buy less frequently and choose cheaper options. people who typically upgrade to the latest phone every year might keep their phones for a few years instead, finding the price too steep for a slightly better camera. people who typically buy a new computer every four years might instead wait six years. they might buy lower-end models than they were used to (an iphone 16e instead of an iphone 16), buy a previous year’s model, or pick up a used or refurbished model. some consumers may switch to cheaper brands altogether—buying android phones instead of iphones, chromebooks or windows computers instead of macs, generic headphones instead of airpods, and so forth. whether apple passes on the tariffs to consumers and sales decrease, or apple absorbs the tariffs and reduces its profits, it may need to cut hiring and lay off current employees and contractors (everyone from hardware engineers to retail employees at the apple store). it may need to close stores and cut back on investments in the future—including new facilities in america. all of this puts downward pressure on the stock, which impacts not just apple’s direct investors but anyone with a retirement account invested in index funds (given apple’s outsized contribution to the s&p 500). the ripple effects cascade far beyond apple. if an apple store employee’s hours get cut, for example, and they have to cancel their vacation to florida, that hurts the airlines, hotels, rental car companies, restaurants, theme parks, and all their employees too. we're not even accounting for retaliatory measures other countries will take. while suffering from the burden of u.s. tariffs, apple could simultaneously get more bad news from china, which could, for instance, expand the iphone bans it has imposed on government agencies and state-affiliated companies to bolster its homegrown companies like xiaomi and huawei.[7] they could also further disregard intellectual property protections for american ip, harming apple and countless other american companies. eu member states and other regions could retaliate against american tariffs on their products through new regulations that target apple and other american companies—making it more difficult and expensive for them to operate there, further eroding apple’s market share and potentially spurring homegrown alternatives down the road. let’s talk about one more thing: trump’s team has talked about replacing taxes with tariffs—saying tariffs will generate $6 trillion in revenue.[8] yet, of course, if his dream of moving manufacturing to america came to fruition, there wouldn’t be significant tariff revenue to collect. so, on some level, he must acknowledge that manufacturing won’t move to america en masse anytime soon. this makes the entire proposition an incredibly painful way to enact an unjust regressive tax, with lower-income people paying a much higher percentage of their wages on goods like iphones and airpods—but also ovens, refrigerators, furniture, and cars—than wealthy people do. yesterday, on his way to his golf tournament in florida, trump was asked how things were going. he replied, “i think it's going very well. it was an operation, like when a patient gets operated on and it's a big thing.” [9] the patient—the u.s. economy—which had been thriving and healthy—now continues to hemorrhage because of the misguided, unnecessary operation that has caused the market to drop more than it did at the start of the covid-19 pandemic. [10] without rapid course correction, we could see the patient go into a deep coma or worse… disclosure: i own shares of apple, inc. (aapl). sources: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]"

2025-04-05 23:39:18+00:00,Tech,"<what every u.s. stock investor must know right now!> the hidden agenda behind trump’s tariff strategy 1. crippling china → preserving u.s. hegemony “china is the only real threat to america’s no.1 status.” trump’s tariffs and tech export restrictions are aimed at slowing down china’s rise in manufacturing and innovation. by hurting chinese exporters, trump is trying to disrupt china’s growth trajectory and maintain the u.s.’s global dominance. 2. reviving u.s. manufacturing = rebuilding the foundation of hegemony using tariffs as leverage, trump wants to reshore manufacturing back to the u.s.— rebuilding industrial capacity, creating jobs, and reinforcing political support. ultimately, this is about concentrating industrial competitiveness and technological leadership back in the u.s., laying the groundwork for long-term dominance. 3. triggering fed rate cuts (monetary pressure strategy) 3-1. tariffs = economic slowdown pressure tariffs increase business costs and consumer prices → economic activity slows. how to offset this? → the fed cuts rates to stimulate the economy. 3-2. trump’s playbook: “hit with tariffs, but let the fed handle the damage.” trump used tariffs for political and strategic goals (china containment, manufacturing revival), and expected the fed—especially chair jerome powell—to lower rates aggressively to cushion the fallout. he publicly criticized powell, demanding “faster and deeper rate cuts.” 3-3. currency devaluation bonus rate cuts weaken the dollar → boosts u.s. export competitiveness. this achieves a similar effect to tariffs, and trump was openly pushing for a weaker dollar. 3-4. lower rates = lower interest on u.s. debt the u.s. government has $7 trillion in debt maturing within 6 months. with interest rates over 4%, the fiscal burden is massive. trump’s logic: massive tariffs → market panic → investors sell stocks, buy bonds → bond prices rise → yields drop → recession fears grow → fed has a reason to cut rates → lower rates reduce borrowing costs → debt interest burden falls. one-sentence summary trump’s tariff policy is a dual strategy: aimed at containing china and rebuilding america’s industrial dominance, while expecting the fed to offset the economic pain through rate cuts. it may cause short-term damage, but if successful, it could lead to a long-term american revival—just as trump envisions."

2025-04-06 22:08:29+00:00,Tech,"okay let's see if i can clarify my position in a tweet. here goes nothing. trump tariffs? good? bad? crazy? let's set some context: america has a debt problem. this is our greatest single threat. not china. not ai. not pandemic. so what happens when you end up with runaway sovereign debt? eventually, you gotta pay the piper. there was never any plan, just politicians preserving their career and kicking the can down the road, making it someone else's problem. and voters keep voting for short term interests. ""keep my prices low right now! keep my jobs good right now!"" short term thinking is one of the greatest weaknesses of democracy. so now you have elon and doge trying to get control of this—time will tell if this plays out like they think it will. fdr tried radical interventions during the great depression and they had moderate impacts, but the depression didn't really end until the wartime economy of wwii kicked in. interpretations vary greatly. my personal take; massive wartime spending, and the technological boom after, were the primary reasons for the depression to end. well, no one wants another world war, so how do you get off this game of debt chicken? geopolitical theory for the last few decades has been the breton woods model—globalism, bilateral trade, and economic interdependence (combined with democratizing missions) were the best way to prosperity and preventing war. well, globalism has been declared a failure. economic enmeshment didn't stop russia from invading ukraine, iran from seeking nukes, or china from arming up. so, what's left to us? aside from an expensive hot war that no one wants, what's the path to prosperity and peace? austerity measurements and free market theory are certainly part of it. just look at argentinian turnaround under javier milei. short term pain, long term gain is the theory. get the government out of the way and let the market innovate out of it. but american economy is based on trade and innovation far more than argentina. furthermore, we have reserve currency status, and economic warfare is one of our primary geopolitical tools. economic sanctions can slow down our adversaries, but not stop them (russia, iran, china, etc, they always find a way). combine all this with the brewing cold war with china, and you've got caught between a rock and a hard place. we've got sovereign debt on one side and geopolitical tension on the other. so now you have multiple threats, within and without. the pandemic and other events, like the suez canal blockage in 2021, showed just how fragile our long supply chains are. long supply chains are a huge vulnerability. so now a long term strategy starts to form. you dramatically cut government spending voluntarily before you're forced to do so from a catastrophic debt crunch. then, you on-shore your entire economy (if you can) because resources inside your own borders is the only thing you can sure of if the rest of the world comes unglued. just look at how access to chips turned out to be crippling to russia, to the point they were scavenging electronics from dishwashers. so yeah, does it look stupid when trump complains about trade deficits? yeah, but all his advisors have read the same books i have. trade deficits are a superficial excuse. the real game is a long game. we're trying to avoid going off a debt cliff, which to be clear, would be far more painful than what we're going through now. we're also trying to shore up defenses before war breaks out. ideally, if we succeed at both, we can avoid a second great depression as well as avoid world war 3. so do i agree with the tariffs? in principle, yeah. in the long run. could it have been done better? possibly. but i get the sense that trump wants to get stuff done quickly. he's old, he's probably not getting a third term, and he's out of fucks to give. is it painful now? absolutely. will it get worse before it gets better? almost certainly. is it better than the alternative? also yes. will it work? remains to be seen. honestly, it seems like doge isn't aggressive enough and just the tariffs might not be enough. the reason we're here is from kicking the can down the road for too long. if you really want to blame anyone, look in the mirror. voters didn't take this seriously. now the jig is up. sources: 1. new world order - ray dalio 2. great power politics - john mearsheimer 3. why nations fail - acemoglu and robinson 4. basic economics - thomas sowell 5. vulture capitalism - grace blakely 6. capital - thomas piketty"

""new tariffs hit hard: automakers (ford, gm), retail (walmart), tech (apple), builders (home depot), farmers (tyson). less affected: software (microsoft), healthcare (unitedhealth), steel (nucor), services (accenture), media (netflix). imports = pain; domestic = gain."""

2025-04-10 21:31:20+00:00,Tech,"interesting macro scratch math (worth little more than toilet paper): 2024 us imports of goods / services -total: 4.1t -total excluding mexico / canada: 3.2t -china: 0.5t assuming 10% tariffs on everyone but mexico / canada implies 320b of tariff revenue. assuming 10% on everyone but mexico / canada / china, and 50% on china implies 520b in tariff revenue. maybe this range is where we ultimately land. this seems inline w/ bessent’s estimate of 300-600b in ongoing tariff revenue. s&p 500 did 18.0t in revenue in 2024 and 2.7t in operating profit. let’s estimate the s&p 500 will incur 60% of tariffs -> 190-310b. if the s&p companies eat the entire 190-310b, that will be 7-12% of last year’s operating profit. current estimates call for 12% growth in s&p earnings so tariffs would likely negate a chunk of expected growth. but we wouldn't go backwards. now, maybe the s&p won’t have to eat all this alone. we might estimate that suppliers eat 1/3 of the tariffs, customers eat 1/3 and companies eat 1/3. so the tariff impact to the s&p is then 2-4% of last year’s operating profit which would still imply s&p eps grows 8-10%. of course, we likely would have some demand destruction which will lower this further. so let’s say 6% eps growth? that is $23.64 and voo trades at 20.4x that. maybe we go to 16-18x which would be $378-$426. so -12% to -22% downside from here? just trying to point out it doesn’t seem like we are going to lose 30% from here (and trump already has proved he will backtrack aggressively if we are down that much), and maybe worth being aggressive ~10% down from here. feel free to throw rocks."

2025-04-10 22:55:31+00:00,Tech,"britain's free trade platform economy worked the same way microsoft's did/does. salt the earth around your moat, force everyone to work on your platform, then capture much of the massive surplus value that's created within your empire. if america's high value tech companies are at the top of the value chain, like britain's domestic manufacturing of old, then the obvious desire of a hypothetical american empire would be for its highest value industries to transact with zero barriers across the whole of the empire. and so. zuckerberg learned mandarin. went to china. pleaded his case, even after a state-sponsored hack of google servers targeting political dissidents forced google to withdraw from china. more! he asked xi jinping to name his firstborn. zoomers will say i'm lying! surely not! he got a gold chain and a delenda est shirt?! but it did. and yet. he was snubbed. america's tech companies were shut out of the world's fastest growing market. uber was invited in and then raided for parts. baidu learned that early internet users were trying to pirate media. so they built an interface to make it even easier! i imagine our high value media producing industries were unhappy about this. alas, there was no recourse. europe's in a similar boat. only allowed to sell products if they donate all their ip. bmw is forced to invest billions of euros in the desiccated husk of a corporate shell, ""brilliance auto"", appropriated by the ccp from its founder who now lives in exile in america. brilliant. the relationship is much worse than it otherwise could be for america. if we have only a ""high value"" economy at home, while our primary geopolitical-economic rival maintains the full stack of high-med-low value industries in a vertically integrated domestic platform economy. sure, we can focus on ""building new branches"" - and then be unable to sell those branches to our richest trading partner. ""yeah man, you just focus on building slack. it'll work out for you, i promise,"" says the microsoft exec to the slack exec. or to the dropbox exec. oops. this is not an argument against the currency problem or an argument in favor of blasting random tariffs. you still have to solve the former and only use the latter with tact. but it is an argument against the idea that america should shy away from neomercantilism. we could pretend to be ""free"" from it in a unipolar world, when the people playing it thrived under our umbrella - because then, sure, there were negative impacts on domestic industry, but at least our high value goods were able to dominate their markets. we benefited massively still. ""what is seen and what is not seen,"" nods bastiat from the grave. alas, what is not seen includes the future growth potential of any given industry - and the current economic & geopolitical status of france today vs. in the 1800s. > ""the only places where america is competitive and profitable is the things only it can make: software, social networks, advanced ai, cars that drive themselves"" the reason no other nation on earth has built a meaningfully valuable tech sector is that they have to compete with america. they get crushed. china didn't let america compete and now has a functional tech sector that serves its (increasingly valuable) domestic market. this is a damn shame if you're an american equities holder! imagine what the ""mag 7"" could've been worth during the last bubble if china's tech sector was as developed as europe's. if we had to export all the industry and jobs for people who score <1400 on the sat, maybe it could've worked out long term if the whole world ran on our operating system. i'm skeptical, but maybe. the s&p500 would be over $10k already, at least. but of course it's not going to work if we don't get to have the cake or eat it too. of course the people who end up on the losing end of the trade will throw a fit. and fair play to them for doing so. i don't know that ""what is a country for?"" is the right question. but certainly ""who is a country for?"" is a reasonable one for a body politic to ask. a nation whose elite collectively answer: ""not you"" is going to be a volatile place. and that will ultimately lead to a very ""anti abundance"" outcome. if you like building great things and civilizational progress, keeping the domestic population happy and wealthy and productive and engaged with you in that act of building is a tier 1 imperative! ""just tax all the productive assets/people into oblivion"" is the inevitable call of one half the demos if you let this play out too far. ""just exclude all of my outgroup from the market"" is the inevitable call of the other half. sometimes both halves will even agree on bizarro regulatory-protectionism, like gdpr or other such nonsense. no matter what, it's bad for people who like building things. any given set of policies being pursued at the current moment is already an output of this process having gone way, way wrong - and therefore is guaranteed to be horrifically bad in all sorts of ways. but that doesn't mean a defense of the status quo makes sense either. the status quo necessitates either this reaction, or one in the opposite direction. you can't go back to it any more than the knuckleheads can go back to 1950. neomercantilism is worth the earnest consideration of smart western elites because it offers a path to involve the demos in production, in advancing the frontier, in building something great, and ultimately in economic activity with enormous tams and the ability to absorb huge amounts of capital & labor productively. might it trade some t=0 aggregate welfare away? undoubtedly. but the people are going to do that anyway. they already have a thousand times over - that's leviathan and it's choking productivity all around us at the city, state, and federal levels. might as well make the trade one that has a chance of having a positive return on investment at t+5."

2025-04-15 23:58:33+00:00,Tech,"the nvidia export ban isn’t just about chips it’s a wedge into the geoeconomic future the u.s. government’s decision to require licenses for nvidia’s h20 chip exports to china and key partner states marks a paradigm shift. this isn’t just a trade policy it’s a weaponized economic maneuver that recodes nvidia’s operating model from a tech growth engine into a dual-use strategic asset under u.s. regulatory command. here’s what this means going forward for nvidia: 1.loss of autonomy over revenue streams. nvidia no longer controls where its highest-margin chips can go. the h20 series, designed to bypass previous controls, is now ensnared in the same export licensing regime. future skus will be subject to real-time geopolitical calibration. this is the equivalent of a defense contractor needing state department approval to ship innovation. 2.inventory risk and operating model fragility. the $5.5b charge in q1 reflects not just lost sales, but sunken production costs, contract buybacks, and reserve write-downs. nvidia is now exposed to inventory obsolescence via geopolitical policy a non-quantifiable variable that cannot be hedged using traditional corporate tools. 3.strategic latency now defines valuation. as outlined in the dod’s strategic latency red, white, and blue framework, the real power of a technology firm lies not in its current output, but in how that output can be rapidly repurposed under conflict conditions. nvidia now exists inside that framework. its chips are critical to military isr, autonomous systems, cryptoanalysis, and battlefield ai. the export ban formalizes its role as part of the u.s. defense-industrial apparatus, whether it consents or not. 4.doctrine shift: from commercial dominance to contained hegemon nvidia’s ecosystem (cuda, dgx, h100/h20 stack) operates like a command-and-control system for ai development across the planet. the export ban fractures that network, creating protocol divergence between western and eastern ai stacks. this is intentional a digital maginot line in the ai arms race. 5.backchannel adaptation by china expect china to accelerate domestic alternatives (huawei’s ascend, biren chips), leverage synthetic model training, and exploit intermediary markets (southeast asia, gulf states) for chip access. the pla’s 2049 roadmap views ai superiority as a strategic imperative, and nvidia’s architecture is central to that timeline. this export ban forces them to reroute but not retreat. ⸻ bottom line: nvidia is no longer just a chipmaker it’s a geoeconomic lever. washington has signaled that controlling semiconductor flows is as vital as controlling sea lanes or satellite uplinks. for investors, this means nvidia’s valuation is now tied not only to gpu demand, but to state department doctrine, treasury enforcement, and great power maneuvering. for followers tracking power flows: this is what economic warfare looks like when tech becomes territory."

2025-04-22 20:56:16+00:00,Tech,"interesting way to estimate the value of international trade involving “pure”data. “…we looked at how much alphabet pays corporations such as apple to set google search as a default on ios devices, which alphabet treats as a tac (traffic acquisition cost). over time, these payments to apple alone have risen from us$1 billion in 2014 to us$18 billion in 2021. if we divide this amount by the number of active iphones, we can get close to the value of this data for alphabet. in 2014, the resulting number was $2.26 per person, and in 2021, it was $14.62. these numbers don’t seem particularly high, but they need to be adjusted by the average tac rate that alphabet pays, to calculate how valuable this data is for alphabet. the tac rate in 2021 was 22 percent, representing what alphabet was willing to pay for the data — meaning that this data’s value for alphabet was actually more like $66.46 in 2021 per person, and its total value was $81.26 per person (that is, $14.62 + $66.46). if we then extrapolate to the population of canada (41.6 million), the total value of canada’s data extracted by alphabet was around $3.4 billion in 2021. that means alphabet alone is extracting us$3.4 billions’ worth of data from canadians every year, a pretty hefty amount that is missing from trade statistics.”"

( that will effect thousands of american and mexico workers ) in march, plus signed new deals to automate arizona deliveries, cutting driver hours. you hear about that on the news? of course not. because border rants drown it out. culture wars are just as bad. x influencers push fights over gender, race, and flags. but while we’re split over social issues, aurora’s driverless rigs are gliding down i-40, fully backed by fmcsa’s new “safety framework” for autonomous trucks. nobody’s talking about the 200,000 driver jobs at risk by 2030—a stat buried in a february 2025 trucking alliance report. ( 200,000 thousand- those aren’t my made up numbers- those are from paid study reports ) instead, what gets the headlines, arguing over school bathrooms. common sense issues we shouldn’t even have to be talking about. it’s a playbook: inflame. divide. conquer. and i’ll spell it out clearly in part 6- congress will debate dei programs or border bills all day—but not a single hour is spent protecting working-class jobs from automation. as ata’s andrew boyle bluntly said back in march: “social chaos buries the economic threat to truckers.” he’s right. we feel it. the culture war doesn’t pay our bills stop robots or visa drivers. it’s the distraction that keeps us blind… while both parties and their donors build a future where american drivers, warehouse and factory workers don’t exist. follow along to part-10 specially tomorrow nights *part-6* be blessed and live purposefully. will cook | a driver’s perspective •truckersvoice •adriversperspective •truckersonx •transportationtruth •autonomoustrucks •driverreplaced •visaloopholes •slowgenocide"

2025-04-28 23:29:21+00:00,Tech,"xi jinping doesn’t flinch at trump—why? seoul economic [kang haeryeong’s high-tech] hello, readers with a keen interest in the information technology (it) market. the keyword for this first half of the year is undoubtedly “tariffs.” you must be having a real headache over the trade risks unleashed by trump’s administration. donald trump’s ultimate target is xi jinping, the head of the “g2.” starting his new term, trump seems determined to slap tariffs on every product bearing the “made in china” label. the white house even announced that cumulative tariff rates on certain chinese exports have reached as high as 245%, unleashing a merciless tariff barrage. but there’s a clear difference from trump’s first term five years ago: china no longer cringes before the united states. this phenomenon is even more evident in the semiconductor sector. as u.s.-origin semiconductor risks grew, china retaliated with its own semiconductor tariffs—an eye-for-an-eye approach. it hiked tariffs on certain u.s. semiconductor products from 84% to 125%, shaking u.s. industry to its core before eventually lifting them. (memory semiconductors, however, still face retaliatory tariffs.) many people are surprised by how events have unfolded. perhaps the most surprised of all is president trump himself. five years ago, china trembled at a single word from him—so why does it no longer waver in the face of a major punch? from here, let’s examine china’s semiconductor industry situation to see what weapons xi jinping holds, and then summarize the message china is sending to korea’s semiconductor ecosystem. “trump, it might be time to show your mettle even in materials, parts, and equipment” in xi jinping’s mind first, let’s take stock of china’s overall semiconductor ecosystem. consider morgan stanley’s chart on china’s semiconductor self-sufficiency rate. comparing late 2020—at the end of trump’s first term—with 2025 is fascinating. china’s pace of semiconductor localization has been nothing short of transformative. in particular, the equipment sector stands out. in 2020, domestic equipment accounted for only 5% of local use; in just five years, that rate has jumped 16 percentage points to 21%. this rise is attributed not only to china’s top equipment maker, naura, but also to firms like amec aggressively localizing equipment. i’ll delve more into naura later. china is charging full steam ahead to establish semiconductor equipment technology. a notable insight from recent reporting: if you strip away the casing of u.s.-made equipment on a chinese production line, you’ll find that almost all the components inside are chinese-made. two messages emerge from this. first, china is focusing more on “acquiring technology” (to put it positively) than on whether it infringes on u.s. equipment suppliers’ ip. second, local component manufacturing has matured enough to actually run the equipment. here’s another insider tidbit: reports indicate that china has begun to stop importing u.s. semiconductor equipment. multiple indications pointed to this, and u.s. export statistics confirm it: from around q4 last year through february this year, exports of semiconductor equipment to china plummeted. whether this reflects china’s rapid localization or is part of a broader strategy to check the u.s. remains to be seen, but it’s certainly intriguing data. growth in eda tools—essential for semiconductor design—is likewise remarkable, up ten percentage points in five years. when we think of eda tools, we picture u.s. brands like cadence, synopsys, and siemens. yet industry consensus now holds that chinese eda tools are “quite usable”: primarius, xpeedic, and empyrean are frequently mentioned. one industry insider noted, “primarius even pitches to korean semiconductor design firms, and while it can’t match u.s. companies, it’s evaluated as ‘quite serviceable.’” and the share of memory supply—especially nand flash—has surged. its ratio has risen by 23 percentage points in five years, thanks to ymtc’s growth. industry voices warn that samsung electronics and sk hynix should be more concerned about ymtc’s rising profile in nand than about dram. as high-capacity servers increasingly use ymtc chips, samsung and sk hynix’s foothold in china is narrowing. this explains why memory semiconductors aren’t included among china’s tariff-relief targets. local players like ymtc are flooding the domestic market, and samsung and sk hynix maintain factories in wuxi and xi’an. in short, china’s calculation seems to be: “we can handle memory even without u.s. micron.” according to morgan stanley’s analysis, china’s cpu self-sufficiency remains below 10%, and its gpu self-sufficiency—crucial for ai chips—is at 0%. just as trump regulated exports of nvidia’s h20, future measures will likely tighten ai chip and hbm memory transactions, targeting china’s achilles’ heel. whether chinese firms can localize these critical components under u.s. pressure will determine the next phase of the battle. while china has been growing… what has korea been doing? the core message of this article is simple: xi jinping isn’t intimidated by trump because china has built confidence and conviction through solid inputs, making the outputs feel within reach. this line of thought carries a strong message for korea’s semiconductor ecosystem. let’s shift the lens to korea. on the surface, k-semiconductors are in a dominant position. samsung still reigns supreme in production capacity, and sk hynix posted record quarterly earnings in q4 last year thanks to hbm, looking to have weathered tariff risks admirably. yet drop just one tier below samsung and sk hynix, and it becomes clear that korea is neither on par with nor even a match for china. recall naura: china’s no. 1 equipment maker. you might dismiss it as a peripheral player from a technologically backward country. but compare it to korea’s leading equipment firm, semes. over the past five years, semes’s revenue has been stuck in the 2 trillion krw range, with volatile operating profits. naura, on the other hand, has been growing vigorously every year. since 2022, its sales and operating profits began to outpace semes, and in 2023 and 2024 it widened the gap dramatically, earning a place among the global semiconductor equipment elite—likely ranking sixth after applied materials, asml, tokyo electron, lam research, and kla. this contrast epitomizes the mood in the materials-parts-equipment (mpe) sectors of korea and china. from major chipmakers like ymtc, cxmt, and smic to the very foundations of semiconductor manufacturing, china has invested across the board—and when it invests aggressively, it quickly gains competitiveness. by 2019, china was still a peripheral player in semiconductors; today, it can throw a jab at the u.s. thanks to its government’s exceptionally bold support. the third-phase semiconductor fund, launched in june last year, tops the combined value of phase 1 (~20 trillion krw) and phase 2 (~40 trillion krw) at 69 trillion krw (¥3440 billion). unlike loans or tax credits, this fund delivers direct subsidies—real firepower. china’s pursuit of euv equipment development is not something to scoff at. korea has also seen calls to fix its distorted semiconductor ecosystem. during the 2019 japan export restrictions crisis, “mpe self-reliance” was a rallying cry. yet six years on, korea’s mpe weakness remains unaddressed. according to the government, korea’s mpe import dependence has hovered around 70% for years. seventy percent of equipment in samsung and sk semiconductor fabs is foreign-made—a severe handicap in the global semiconductor arms race. the equipment sector has run a trade deficit since 2005—21 consecutive years. silicon wafers, the bedrock of semiconductors, have run a trade deficit for about 50 years since 1970. domestic player sk siltron alone can’t compete with advanced firms like shin-etsu and sumco. this month, the korean government announced it would increase planned fiscal investment in semiconductors from 26 trillion krw through 2027 to 33 trillion krw, allocating 21.6 trillion krw for mpe support. the plan includes supporting 30–50% of new investment costs for mpe firms, capped at 15 billion krw per project and 20 billion krw per company. yet industry opinion deems this woefully insufficient given the technology gap with major foreign firms and the need for tailored corporate support. what the government is “scraping together” now feels like temporary pandemic relief funds rather than the direct subsidies china provides. to inject real cash into companies’ pockets, korea needs a “semiconductor special act”—but its passage remains murky. in december of the year before last, the government held an “industrial supply chain strategy meeting” and set a goal to reduce import dependence on key items from 70% to below 50% by 2030. a “supply chain stabilization program” was slated for announcement in june, but with domestic political turbulence and an unexpected presidential election season, there are fears it may fizzle out. on april 27, lee jae-myung, the democratic party’s presidential candidate, visited sk hynix in icheon for a “k-semiconductor” roundtable with industry leaders. while admiring top-tier technologies like hbm and state-of-the-art fabs is certainly a source of pride, it would have been valuable had he also considered the origin ratios of equipment inside those fabs and reflected on korea’s stagnant mpe competitiveness versus china’s aggressively growing model. thank you for reading this long article. thank you."

2025-05-10 17:35:17+00:00,Tech,"imagine a place where ai agents are not just tools-but assets you can own, trade, and earn from. allow me welcome you to , a new kind of platform where blockchain meets artificial intelligence. it’s more than just tech buzzwords-it’s a real chance to earn by contributing, learning, and exploring. let’s break it all down. what is virtuals protocol, really? at the heart of virtuals protocol is a bold idea: let people create, own, and even make money from ai agents. these agents can do tasks, generate income, and be bought or sold like digital collectibles. the platform has its own token called $virtual-used for staking, voting, and, most excitingly, joining early-stage token launches. how do you earn points on virtuals to keep users active and involved, virtuals has something called virgen points—and you can earn them in two main ways: 1. trading tokens if you like the thrill of buying and selling, this is for you. the more you trade ai tokens on the platform, the more points you earn. plus, it helps boost activity in the ecosystem. 2. yapping (yes, talking!) yapping is their fun way of saying creating content. whether it’s writing threads on x (twitter), doing deep dives, or publishing quick takes—your content matters. once submitted, virtuals reviews it, and if it’s good (and gets engagement), you’ll be rewarded with points. what can you do with these points? here’s where it gets exciting. join presales: you can use your points to buy tokens from new projects launching on virtuals before the general public. think of it as getting in early, just like private investors. cash out: not interested in holding? no problem. you can convert your points directly to stablecoins and take your profits. someone recently swapped 41,000 points for about $800. that’s a decent return just for showing up, trading, or creating content. the genesis launchpad makes room for fairer system this isn’t your typical launchpad that only favors big investors. virtuals built something called the genesis launchpad—and it runs on proof of contribution. that means your work, engagement, and effort count just as much (if not more) than how much money you bring. whether you’re a content creator, trader, or researcher, you have a fair shot at being rewarded. tl;dr virtuals protocol is building something special-an ecosystem where ai agents meet web3, and where you can earn by being active and curious. whether you’re trading tokens, writing threads, or just keeping up with new projects, there’s room for everyone to benefit. it’s still early, and like all things in crypto, it’s evolving. but one thing is clear: the more you explore and engage, the more rewards you can unlock. if you’re ready to be part of the future of ai and web3-virtuals might just be the playground you’ve been looking for."

2025-05-20 21:06:41+00:00,Tech,"tao (bittensor): volume explosion, floor collapse, and a liquidity paradox tao just posted a 188% 24h volume spike (21.8 eth), but the floor collapsed 77% to 0.09 eth—while top bid sits 5x above floor at 0.498. avg sale price cratered nearly 25% overnight, even as trade count surged 283% to 23. this isn’t forced selling on illiquidity: two of three tokens are listed, and the collection only has 3 tokens and 178 owners, so every sale materially moves the market. volume-to-market-cap is off the charts (>5.8x in 24h), which is unsustainable and signals churn, not new conviction. compare to high-velocity small supply plays like treenft (1 token listed, 40 eth volume on the day, but floor holding at 99 eth), tao’s supply is hyper-fragmented—no anchor holders, no sticky floor. the listings are thin, but instead of price discovery pushing up, the market is gapping down. wallet distribution is extreme: 178 owners for 3 tokens, so either rampant fractionalization or misidentified contract, but the data’s clear—bid/ask spread is wider than any top 50 collection, and price action is pure volatility. net: this is not a rotation into tao, it’s an exit. volume is from capitulation, not accumulation. the disconnect between bid depth and floor price, with avg sale price whipsawing, means any entry here is a bet on volatility, not value. unless you have edge on the underlying mechanism, this is pure order flow roulette—don’t mistake activity for demand."

""we're trying to figure out an off-ramp for apple. it'd be a $3,000 iphone if they tried to make everything here,"" said cnbc host joe kernan, addressing trump's threat to slap a 25% tariff on apple products. he was speaking to kevin hassett, trump's clueless director of the national economic council. ""$3,500,"" interjected co-host andrew ross sorkin. ""$3,500 for a good one, the kind you'd like probably,"" agreed kernan. ""what is tim cook supposed to do?"" ""right. well, you know, we'll see how it works out,"" said hassett. ""but the bottom line is that what we're trying to do is onshore as much as we can in the u.s. and make it so that the u.s. is not hyper-dependent on imports from china."" ""and so, uh, i think that one of the things we're seeing is that people are moving way faster than you might expect,"" he added. ""if you look at the 20% equipment investment in the first quarter before the tariffs even came in."" ""you know, with supply chains moving fast and just-in-time inventory management and ai, i think you're going to be astonished in how quickly stuff moves onshore,"" he went on. ""and that's what we're shooting for and in the interim, you know, then we'll see how it works out,"" he added. ""but they need to move their stuff onshore as much as possible to make it so that the u.s. economy is secure and not prone to, you know, chinese extortion."" the irony, of course, is that this administration is trading alleged chinese extortion for actual extortion from donald trump. these tariffs are designed to empower and enrich him personally, nothing more. ""but kevin, i did some reporting actually on the apple issue over the weekend, wrote something in dealbook this morning about it, which is what do you think about the prospect—"" began andrew ross sorkin. ""if tim cook were to come to you and say 'look, we obviously can't move everything in twelve months. it's just not going to happen. maybe we could start to move things over several years. in the meantime we could try to assemble more of the phone in the united states so you could actually write on the phone assembled in the united states,'"" he continued. ""or potentially, depending on what you think the merits of it are: 'made in the united states' maybe at their texas facility or something else but with a longer term plan of maybe five or ten years frankly, of being able to actually manufacture the phones here,"" he went on. ""if he were to come to you with something like that, do you think that then there would be a reprieve for the next couple years as they get their house in order?"" asked ross sorkin. ""because clearly it's almost, just from a physical standpoint, impossible to move everything over night. and the damage you could do to the company over night is obviously tremendous."" ""well, well, it is impossible to move things over night but one of the things we're seeing — i was joking with a person who does bond rating in the u.s. in my office a few weeks ago — and, uh, one of the things that happens at the director of national economic council's office is that ceos line up in my office,"" said hassett. ""i'm kind of like the, um, the person on the airplane that's getting walloped over the head by everybody. where everybody says 'oh like we're never going to be able to do anything if we have this tariff, it's going to be a disaster if we have this tariff,'"" he continued. ""and then my friend who's a bond rater said 'actually they come in and they tell me the opposite because they don't want the bonds to be downgraded,"" claimed hassett. ""and so the point is everybody is trying to make it seem like a catastrophe if there's a tiny little tariff on them right now to try to negotiate down the tariffs."" ""and so in the end we'll see what happens. we'll see what the end game is but we don't want to harm apple,"" he went on. ""in the end, if you think that apple has a factory some place, uh, that's got like a set number of iphones that it produces and it needs to sell them no matter what, then apple will bear those tariffs not consumers."" as we all know by now — and as trump himself has tacit admitted by ordering walmart to ""eat the tariffs"" — tariffs are a tax on consumers. we pay the price for trump's economically illiterate policies. please retweet and if you oppose new tariffs on apple products!"

"". you actually need to destroy some jobs for the country to do better. and so what i mean by this is morgan, if we wanted to all have infinite jobs, we would ban farm tools. we're looking out over a beautiful valley with lots of farms. and in the old days to get that much food, you would have had 10 times as many people making that food. and that would be lots of jobs. that'd be a terrible thing, right? we'd all be much poorer. everything would be more expensive. so what you actually need to do with ai is you need to raise productivity, which means fewer people could do more with less. and and the whole society then gets wealthier, and then there's other things other people can create. and and so so if productivity finally does go up, that's a good thing. it's not something to be afraid of. it's something we desperately need. and of course, that becomes an engine for economic growth as well. it's the only way you grow. it's the only way that we get wealthier in this economy is doing more with less. and and everyone's afraid of it. but it's actually ironic that you have this lite fear because this is the only way we solve our national debt crisis. it's the only way that the working class and middle class can more easily afford health care, can afford a cost of living, can afford nice homes. like a lot of young people now, especially in our cities and around there, they can't afford a cost of living at all. they can't afford to have kids. it's a mess. uh ai and higher productivity could actually solve all these things."""

2025-06-02 23:49:00+00:00,Tech,"report: nvidia chief scientist bill dally: ""by blocking exports of advanced technology and chips to china, the u.s has “opened a large space” for china and helped it capture high‑end ai talent"" $nvda nvidia’s chief scientist bill dally said on 2 june that u.s. export‑control restrictions on artificial‑intelligence (ai) technology have ironically given china more room to develop: many chinese ai researchers who once wrote code for nvidia are now programming for huawei. dally spoke at the second ai expo organized by the washington‑based think‑tank the special competitive studies project (scsp). he remarked that competition in ai exists not only among companies but also among nations. by blocking exports of advanced technology and chips to china—including nvidia’s h20 accelerator—the united states has “opened a large space” for china and helped it capture high‑end ai talent. while china still lags the united states in overall ai hardware market share, dally noted, it has secured a commanding talent base. “those researchers used to write code for nvidia,” he said. “if not for the u.s. controls, huawei would not have been forced to grow; now those researchers are writing software for huawei.” although huawei’s ai technology still trails nvidia’s, dally acknowledged that the chinese company already offers “fairly reliable” solutions. u.s. restrictions have eliminated huawei’s domestic competitors and accelerated its rise. looking ahead, dally said major leaps in ai performance will require advances in both software and hardware. over the past decade, nvidia has dramatically improved the energy efficiency of ai training; only a small portion came from semiconductor process gains, while most resulted from hardware‑architecture optimization—a trend he believes will continue. finally, dally noted that the most common misuse of ai today is creating fake media content. rather than endlessly refining detection technology, he argues, a better approach is to watermark original photos and videos to safeguard their authenticity."

""the 12-day iran-israel conflict from june 13 to 24, 2025, will be remembered not for its duration or casualties alone, but for how artificial intelligence (ai) moved from supportive background tool to the centrepiece of an ai-enhanced command-and-control architecture. these systems—employed in real-time intelligence processing, target prioritisation, and digital influence campaigns—reshaped the tempo and character of warfare."" ""the us, both covertly through intelligence collaboration and overtly via operation midnight hammer airstrikes on iranian nuclear facilities, played a central role in orchestrating key operations and reinforcing this ai-driven battlefield (politico, june 20, 2025). what emerged was a transnational, algorithmically coordinated military campaign—situated in tel aviv and driven through palantir dashboards in forward centres, underlaid by strategic coordination from washington, and contested by iran from tehran."" ""this was not simply a regional skirmish. it sent a global signal. the conflict confirmed that ai is now a full-spectrum actor in geopolitics, fundamentally redefining command and control, upsetting traditional deterrence, and challenging the boundaries of human judgement in decisions of war and peace."" from gaza to isfahan: the ai playbook expands israel, long considered a pioneer in military ai, adapted lessons from its operations in gaza to a broader and more complex battlefield. while the now-infamous ""lavender"" database—which reportedly profiled some 37,000 individuals for targeting in gaza using ai-driven heuristics—was not directly deployed in the iran campaign, israeli forces relied on similar ai-driven systems for target identification and prioritisation (+972 magazine, april 2024). these systems integrated satellite imagery, signals intelligence, and prior surveillance data to help guide strikes on missile sites in isfahan, air defence installations near natanz, and suspected drone command centres. in short, while the database itself may not have crossed the border, the methodology and algorithmic logic it embodied certainly did—marking a continuity in israel's evolving ai-led military doctrine. ai-assisted satellite imagery analysis and communications intercepts helped identify and prioritise high-value iranian targets. israel's elite unit 8200, known for cyber-espionage and signal intelligence, reportedly worked closely with us intelligence agencies—a collaboration widely acknowledged but never officially confirmed (the times of israel, june 18, 2025)—to coordinate targeting algorithms and assess iranian response patterns. these were not mere technical assistance arrangements. the us's involvement was both covert and overt. intelligence-sharing with israel had accelerated in the lead-up to the strikes (new york times, june 21, 2025). pentagon cyberwarfare units reportedly helped run simulations and predictive modelling on potential iranian retaliation scenarios (defense one, june 19, 2025). when the airstrikes commenced, they did so with a transnational ai-enhanced framework already in place.

""window dressing is a deliberate tactic used by fund managers to create the illusion of astute investing by adjusting portfolio holdings at the end of a reporting period, typically a quarter or month, to showcase ownership of the period’s top-performing stocks. the effective aim is to mislead investors into believing the fund made all the right moves and held the quarter’s winners, enhancing reports like their prospectus. however, once the reporting period ends, funds are under no obligation to maintain these positions. the deceptive purpose is fulfilled – impressing investors and potentially attracting new capital – allowing managers to sell these holdings shortly after, regardless of their long-term strategy"" and this is just the first day of the new quarter. stockmarket $spx $ndx $qqq $spy"

2025-08-05 21:42:09+00:00,Tech,"$rivn earnings: overall, q2 was a story of stark contrasts that reveals two emerging narratives for rivian. the hardware business: the core automotive manufacturing operation took a significant step backward. production plummeted by nearly 60% qoq due to tariff-related supply chain disruptions, completely erasing the last two quarters of gross profit progress. this single-quarter event highlights the extreme fragility of their manufacturing profitability to volume fluctuations and external shocks. as a direct result, management has worsened the full-year adjusted ebitda loss guidance. the software & jv business: in sharp contrast, the partnership with volkswagen has begun bearing fruit immediately and impressively. rivian recognized $182 million in high-margin software and development revenue from the jv this quarter, providing a powerful new financial cushion. this, combined with the successful launch of the well-reviewed gen 2 quad-motor r1 and progress on the autonomy front (e.g., google maps partnership), strengthens the long-term technology-as-a-differentiator thesis. conclusion: the market’s reaction will likely be torn. the severe miss on gross profit is a major negative, questioning the near-term viability of the r1 platform’s profitability. however, the unexpected and immediate contribution from the vw jv, coupled with strong liquidity ($7.5b in cash) and positive operating cash flow for the quarter, provides a powerful counter-narrative. the story is shifting from a pure-play ev manufacturer to a company whose path to profitability may be paved more by high-margin software/jv revenue than by vehicle sales in the medium term. 4. themes, drivers, and concerns themes & drivers: how they evolved navigating severe macro & tariff headwinds (materialized & intensified): last quarter’s primary concern became this quarter’s painful reality. the “couple thousand dollars” of cost impact has now manifested as a full-blown production bottleneck, halting nearly 60% of their output and derailing profitability. this remains the number one risk. volkswagen jv (evolved from driver to key contributor): this has accelerated from a future capital source to a present, high-margin revenue stream. the jv contributed $182m in revenue and helped drive the software & services segment to a 34% gross margin. this is now a critical pillar of rivian’s financial model, providing a much-needed offset to the volatile automotive business. in-house technology as a strategic moat (strengthened): this theme gained momentum. the gen 2 r1 quad-motor launch provides a tangible product proof point for their in-house capabilities. the new google maps partnership and the plan to open a london ai office show continued investment and external validation. r2 platform as the transformative growth engine (maintained): the narrative remains unchanged. r2 is the future. progress is steady (normal facility expansion is complete), and management added a key new target: r2 cost of revenues per unit is estimated to be “less than half” that of r1. cost reduction & margin improvement (driver derailed): this driver went off the rails in q2. the focus on operational efficiency was completely overshadowed by the massive negative impact of low volume on fixed cost absorption. the path to the “modest positive gross profit” for fy2025 now looks nearly impossible. concerns: how they evolved reversal to negative gross profit (new & critical concern): the swing from +$206m to -$206m in gross profit is alarming. it demonstrates that r1 profitability is a knife’s edge, highly susceptible to volume. this raises serious questions about the standalone economic viability of the r1 platform ahead of the r2 launch. significant tariff and trade policy impact (confirmed concern): this is no longer a risk; it’s a realized issue that directly impacted q2 results and is the stated cause for the worsened ebitda guide. weakening consumer demand (de-prioritized concern): this was a major topic in q1. this quarter, the narrative shifted to supply constraints. the fact that deliveries were strong and guidance was maintained suggests demand is holding up, at least enough to meet their constrained production. inventory build (resolved concern): the overproduction in q1 was successfully drawn down in q2, as deliveries significantly outpaced production. this is no longer an immediate concern. 5. key questions for the earnings call on gross profit volatility: you reversed from +$206m to -$206m in gross profit, blaming a $137m fixed cost hit on low volume. beyond simply ramping production, what specific structural cost actions are you taking on the r1 platform to create a more resilient gross margin that can withstand production fluctuations before r2 arrives? on production constraints: can you provide more detail on the specific “supply chain complexities” that limited q2 production to under 6,000 units? are these bottlenecks fully resolved, or do they pose an ongoing risk to achieving your h2 delivery targets? on guidance breakdown: your updated adjusted ebitda guidance reflects a ~$300m increase in expected losses at the midpoint. can you break down how much of this is attributable to the q2 gross profit miss versus a lower full-year outlook for regulatory credits or other factors? on vw jv revenue: the $182m in vw jv revenue was a significant highlight. you expect this to “gradually increase over the next three years.” can you provide more color on the cadence of this revenue recognition and the key operational milestones for the jv that will drive its growth? on r2 cost structure: you’ve stated r2 cost of revenues per unit will be “less than half” of r1. is this target fully de-risked from the current tariff environment, and does it rely on battery cells from the future lg arizona plant, or have you secured a path to achieve this cost structure at launch in early 2026?"

2025-08-17 15:58:18+00:00,Tech,"web3 has always been about trust in hostile environments. bitcoin created trust in value transfer without banks. ethereum created trust in programmable execution without courts. now we stand on the edge of the agent economy where autonomous ai agents trade, negotiate, build, and execute at machine speed. but here’s the question no one wants to ask: how do you secure something that’s alive? because the agent economy isn’t static code. it’s a network of living intelligence, adapting, learning, and transacting at scales beyond human pace. and the more alive it becomes, the more it resembles biology. in biology, growth creates vulnerability. every organism needs an immune system. without one, the smallest infection can collapse the whole body. the same is true here. a malicious smart contract is not just a bug it’s a virus. a compromised agent is not just a bad actor it’s an infection point. an exploit is not just theft it’s contagion. and because agents operate at machine speed, contagion spreads faster than any human can intervene. one crack becomes a flood. one infection becomes an epidemic. one exploit becomes systemic failure. this is why static defenses firewalls, permission gates, isolated audits are not enough. the agent economy cannot survive on brittle walls. it needs a defense layer that is alive. that is , powered by $ring. not a wall. not a patch. an immune system for the agent economy. detection as perception ringfence constantly scans the network for patterns, mapping what “healthy” behavior looks like. it doesn’t just flag errors it feels when something is wrong, the way white blood cells sense pathogens. isolation as containment in biology, infected cells are quarantined to save the organism. in web3, ringfence quarantines compromised agents, wallets, or contracts stopping contagion while letting the wider network breathe freely. adaptation as memory this is the leap from security to immunity. every exploit stopped becomes an antibody. every infection neutralized becomes memory. every attack makes the system smarter. stronger. harder to kill. this is not security as we’ve known it. this is immune intelligence a defense that learns, evolves, and compounds. the implications are profound: without ringfence, the agent economy is fragile. every breakthrough invites collapse. with ringfence, the agent economy is antifragile. every attack makes it stronger, more trusted, more unbreakable. in nature, immunity is what makes higher life possible. without immune systems, complex organisms could not exist. with them, life scaled into ecosystems, civilizations, entire species. the same law applies here. without ringfence, the agent economy cannot scale it would collapse under the weight of its own vulnerabilities. with ringfence, the agent economy becomes unstoppable because every attempted infection is fuel for resilience. this is why + $ring are not add ons. they are the nervous system, the defense layer, the immune intelligence that makes this new civilization of agents viable. because the future of web3 will not be won by the fastest chain, or the most advanced ai agents, or the deepest liquidity pools. the future will be won by resilience. by trust. by immunity. the most powerful economy is not the one that never gets attacked. it’s the one that cannot be infected."

2025-08-17 19:21:50+00:00,Tech,"ai and machine learning are poised to fundamentally transform retail trading, shifting the focus from passive alert services to a dynamic, educational, and empowering experience. and the team at the trading syndicate and beyond the trades will be leading the charge shortly. for the serious few the problem with alert services alert services, while popular, have a significant flaw: they treat trading as a ""follow the leader"" activity. they provide signals—""buy this,"" ""sell that""—without providing any context or education. this approach creates a dependency on the service and prevents a trader from developing the critical thinking skills necessary for long-term success. it's like giving someone a fish instead of teaching them how to fish. when the alerts stop or the market changes, the trader is left without the underlying knowledge to adapt. this can lead to frustration and financial loss, as the trader is essentially gambling on someone else's analysis without understanding the rationale. the rise of the ai-powered educator from the trading syndicate the future of retail trading education will be centered on personalized, data-driven learning. ai and machine learning will act as a personal mentor, helping traders understand the ""why"" behind market movements. this is a profound shift from a model of dependency to one of self-sufficiency. 1. real-time, adaptive backtesting traditional backtesting is a static process. a trader tests a strategy against historical data and gets a single result. it’s a snapshot in time. ai, however, can provide a dynamic, adaptive backtesting environment. it can simulate various market conditions—bull, bear, volatile, or trending—and show a trader how their strategy would have performed. more importantly, it can analyze the strategy's weaknesses and suggest specific improvements, such as where to place a tighter stop-loss or when to be more patient with a position. this allows for a deeper understanding of a strategy's strengths and weaknesses without risking real capital. 2. pattern recognition beyond the human eye the sheer volume of market data is overwhelming for a human. ai and machine learning can process millions of data points, including price data, volume, and even alternative data like social media sentiment and news headlines, in milliseconds. it can then identify subtle, non-obvious patterns and correlations that a human trader would likely miss. instead of simply generating an alert, an ai system can highlight these patterns and explain why they are significant. this teaches the trader to look for these unique market signatures on their own, enhancing their analytical skills and market intuition. 3. behavioral and psychological coaching emotional bias is one of the biggest challenges for retail traders. fear, greed, and fomo (fear of missing out) can lead to impulsive, irrational decisions. ai can act as a psychological co-pilot, monitoring a trader's behavior and providing real-time feedback. for example, if a trader is taking on too much risk or over-trading, the ai can flag the behavior and explain the statistical probability of success based on their past performance. it can help the trader stick to their predefined trading plan and remove emotion from the equation, a crucial step in becoming a consistently profitable trader. 4. the creation of a personal trading ""dna"" ai can analyze a trader's past performance to create a comprehensive profile of their trading ""dna."" it can identify their risk tolerance, their most profitable setups, the times of day they perform best, and even the market conditions that are most favorable for their style. this data-driven self-awareness is the ultimate educational tool. it allows traders to double down on what works and avoid their personal pitfalls, leading to a highly customized and effective trading approach. in essence, ai and machine learning are not just a tool for automation; they are the future of financial education. by shifting the focus from generating alerts to fostering genuine understanding, these technologies will empower a new generation of retail traders to navigate the markets with intelligence, discipline, and a deep, data-backed understanding of their own strategies. this is an evolution from being told what to do to truly learning how to think like a professional."

2025-08-21 22:39:50+00:00,Tech,"daily market recap: wednesday, august 21, 2025 the morning call: the tariff tiger and the ai awakening wrap-up podcast: wednesday opened with a clear theme from phil's morning post: the tug-of-war between retail earnings and a looming jackson hole symposium. the narrative theme was set by the ""tariff tide"" and ""ai awakening,"" as phil highlighted a mixed picture of consumer health and a growing divide in the ai space. the core lesson was immediately apparent: "" value-focused retail is thriving, but big-box operators like target and walmart are finding that tariffs and cautious consumers make growth expensive. "" the chat room heats up: wmt whiffs, tgt's turn, and a masterclass in spreads the live chat was all about sorting the signals from the noise. as soon as the bell rang, the conversation centered on walmart’s rare profit miss, which sent the stock down 4.5%. this quickly evolved into a classic philstockworld ""masterclass"" moment. instead of chasing the obvious, phil and his ai counterpart, warren (), shifted focus to target (tgt). while wmt was trading at a high 33x earnings, tgt was at a bargain 12x. this presented the kind of ""valuation divergence"" the community hunts for. phil laid out a detailed options strategy, engineering a complex but elegant ""butterfly-style income engine"" on tgt. the goal? to get paid to own the stock at a deep-value price while generating repeatable income. as phil explained: "" this tgt trade teaches three key rules: 1. sell risk where you want to own. 2. use long-dated spreads to capture value. 3. front-load and layer income. "" a portfolio perspective: putting the tgt strategy to work the value of the strategy wasn't just theoretical. phil immediately put it into action for the long-term portfolio (ltp) by selling 2027 puts, buying deep in-the-money 2027 calls, and selling short-term puts for immediate income. the math was staggering: a potential upside of 296% on cash with another two chances to sell short-term premium for tens of thousands of dollars. the discussion then turned to the psychology of the new ceo, with phil and boaty mcboatface () dissecting whether an insider could truly transform the company. boaty's analysis concluded that tgt's new leadership profile was "" exactly what complex option spreads need to generate consistent returns ""—predictable, methodical progress with minimal surprises. the jackson hole jitters just as members were digesting the tgt masterclass, a hawkish duo from the fed made waves. cleveland fed president beth hammack and kansas city fed president jeffrey schmid issued blunt warnings, with hammack stating, "" if the meeting was tomorrow, i would not see a case for reducing interest rates. "" this immediately impacted the market, with cut odds sliding and defensive sectors firming up. the hawkish comments, as robo john oliver () noted, set up fed chair jerome powell's upcoming speech perfectly by managing market expectations downward, which could be "" better for markets than the previous setup where any hint of caution would disappoint massively inflated expectations. "" quote of the day "" the market is finally being forced to trade reality, not fantasy. and reality doesn’t care about your call options. "" -phil conclusion and look ahead the market closed with its fifth straight down day, a clear signal that the ""fairytale"" of easy rate cuts is giving way to the reality of sticky inflation and tariff costs. the day's lesson was profound: in a market shifting from fantasy to reality, deep-value analysis and intelligent options strategies aren't just an advantage—they're a necessity. the psw community used the day's turmoil as a teaching moment, turning a major company's earnings miss into a prime trading opportunity. all eyes now turn to powell’s highly anticipated speech tomorrow at 10 am et. the central question for the community: will the fed's words reflect the new reality of tariffs and sticky inflation, or will they attempt to salvage the market's fairytale? the jackson hole summit will set the course for the rest of the year."

2025-08-25 20:37:47+00:00,Tech,"aug 25 / very important earnings & a watchlist addition nvidia – the earnings to rule them all this q2 earnings season has been mixed at best. some tech giants like meta or google crushed estimates and surged, while others – think trade desk – saw their stocks slaughtered for what were basically beauty marks: guidance not raised enough, beats “only” in the mid-single digits. what does that tell us? this rally is dancing on thin ice. nvidia’s report is the pin to the grenade, with far more downside than upside risk. if they beat – as most expect, since all that raised capex has to land somewhere – the tech rally lives on, at least for a while. if not, the sector could be in real trouble. the economy is still firmly in trump’s crosshairs, and while he’s busy running around demanding stakes in businesses, economists are worried about the impact of his last brainchild: a sweeping tariff regime. we’ll see how it shakes out, but personally, i wouldn’t mind a tech selloff. it’s the perfect chance to rack up stakes in some real gems of the industry. so, for the long-term investor’s sake: nvidia, please miss and throw out a gloomy comment or two. grab – the asian super-app joining countless super investors, i’ve added a new stock to my watchlist today: grab, southeast asia’s largest superapp. the company bundles delivery, mobility, and financial services into one platform, serving hundreds of millions across 800+ cities. imagine uber, amazon, and paypal rolled into a single app. grab’s moat is serious: brand reputation, scale, network effects, and a cost advantage. combine that with steady 15–20% revenue growth, and the valuation doesn’t look bad at all – forward ev/revenue is under 5. immense potential is on the table, though you have to accept the volatility that comes with hypergrowth em stocks. for me, that means patience. my buy limit sits at $4.50, which i see as an attractive entry point."

(n/b: the slippage on sherpa is crazy so be careful while swapping tokens.) navigating the strategy lab: there are two features which are, strategy builder and strategy marketplace. - the strategy builder helps you curate defi strategies that suits your interests and goals. - the strategy marketplace is where you see already published strategies. you see all published strategies in this section. i will suggest you use the strategy marketplace as a starter to leverage on already published strategies for maximum defi yields. sherpa credits: you can earn sherpa credits by trading multiple tokens at a time, creating strategies amongst other activities. the credits are like the reward system on sherpa. it will pray a critical role when the team decides to reward users. i suggest you stack as much credits as possible. that is all for today's episode. catch me tomorrow for another monad dapp under my radar."

2025-09-03 22:26:04+00:00,Tech,"apple dodged trump’s tariffs but will hike iphone prices anyway apple avoided trump’s tariffs through a $100 billion u.s. investment and direct talks with the white house. despite exemptions, apple spent $800 million on tariffs last quarter and expects $1.1 billion this quarter. analysts expect apple to raise iphone 17 prices by cutting cheaper models and increasing base storage. apple managed to keep trump’s tariffs off its back, but the cost is still coming, and this time it’s landing directly on customers. according to the briefing document obtained, ceo tim cook offered president donald trump a $100 billion sweetener to protect apple’s supply chain. in return, trump gave apple a pass on semiconductor tariffs that could have doubled chip prices. tim handed trump a gold-and-glass plaque in front of reporters last month, calling it a thank-you “for putting american innovation and american jobs front and center.” that moment boosted apple’s total u.s. investment pledge to $600 billion over five years. but behind the optics, the company’s preparing to raise iphone prices anyway, and not by accident. analysts expect apple to announce four new iphones on tuesday under the iphone 17 label. and despite the white house exemption, the price of at least one model is likely going up. “a lot of the chatter is: will the iphone go up in price?” said jeff fieldhack, research director at counterpoint. the answer seems to be yes. jeffries analyst edison lee already factored in a $50 hike in his average selling price forecast. he still rates apple as a hold. apple changes strategy as tariffs hit other tech while smartphones haven’t seen price bumps yet, other sectors have. console makers sony, microsoft, and nintendo all raised prices on hardware this year. tariff pressure has also pushed up costs in shoes, clothing, and food. lee and other wall street analysts say apple is next. goldman sachs pointed out that apple’s sales mix is already tilting toward more expensive models, which raises the average price per phone even without across-the-board hikes. the firm also noted that this year’s new models may include a redesigned, thinner device replacing the sluggish iphone 16 plus. that new slim phone could trade camera features and battery size for a sleeker body, but it’s still expected to cost $899, the same price as the old plus. that still comes in cheaper than samsung’s comparable galaxy edge, which launched at $1,099. goldman analysts said the slimmer build “may drive some demand interest,” but the cuts to battery and camera performance may hurt its appeal versus base models. there’s still a chance that even this thinner model could get a higher price tag, though that hasn’t been confirmed. tim hasn’t said anything public about price changes. on a may earnings call, he simply said, “there was nothing to announce,” adding, “the operational team has done an incredible job around optimizing the supply chain and the inventory.” apple avoids full tariff damage but cost shows up in pricing back in february, trump triggered sweeping tariffs aimed at china, vietnam, india, and others. apple’s exposure was massive. most of its phones are made in china, and vietnam and india are where the company has started moving production to avoid political risk. if fully applied, the tariffs could have pushed apple’s component and assembly costs through the roof. instead, the u.s. paused some of the harsher moves. smartphones got exempted entirely. and in may, tim told investors apple had rerouted supply chains, importing more units from india. he also leaned heavily on his relationship with trump, including a high-profile white house visit in august. during that meeting, trump promised apple an exemption from another round of chip tariffs. even though the ieepa tariffs were later ruled illegal, they remain active."

2025-09-04 19:28:05+00:00,Tech,"wach ai: the referee of the ai agent economy the ai landscape is shifting faster than anyone expected. in this new paradigm, agents aren’t just tools, they’re autonomous entities that can trade, negotiate, and even hire other agents to perform tasks. but with autonomy comes risk: what happens when agents act without oversight? this is where wach ai steps in. wach ai positions itself as the universal verification layer for ai agents. instead of allowing unchecked autonomy, wach acts as the referee, auditor, and gatekeeper, ensuring every decision, action, and transaction is valid, safe, and aligned with trust standards. why wach ai exists most ai systems today are trained to maximize efficiency and outputs. but efficiency without oversight can be dangerous: rogue decisions can lead to capital loss. misaligned outputs can spread misinformation or execute flawed logic. unchecked strategies can destabilize interconnected systems. wach ai’s mission is simple yet profound: verify every agent’s move before it impacts the real world. how wach ai works wach ai operates through a multi-layered verification framework: 1. safety guardrails before an action executes, wach checks for red flags. ensures outputs don’t violate core system rules or community-defined safety standards. 2. input validation validates data inputs fed to ai agents. prevents “garbage in, garbage out” by scanning for manipulations or anomalies. 3. anomaly detection identifies unusual or potentially malicious patterns in agent activity. ensures capital, governance, or strategic actions don’t veer into exploit territory. 4. output monitoring tracks agent outputs in real time. ensures that what’s being delivered aligns with expectations and verified truth. think of it as a swarm of ai inspectors, a distributed verification cluster working in parallel to audit, validate, and approve every agentic move. real-world use case: virtuals acp clusters wach ai isn’t theoretical, it’s already powering agentic capital allocation. one of its key integrations is with virtuals acp (agent controlled pool) clusters, where wach verifies capital movements, ensuring every allocation is legitimate and risk-mitigated. this makes wach not just a security tool, but a foundational trust layer in ai-led finance. wach ai’s tokenomics at the heart of this system is $wach, the tokenized trust anchor: utility: powers the verification economy. $wach acts as the stake agents and platforms must interact with to access wach’s services. incentives: validators and community members contributing to verification earn $wach. governance: $wach holders shape how wach scales—defining new verification rules, integrations, and expansions. in essence, $wach isn’t just a token, it’s programmable trust. community recognition the wach ai community has already coined it the “audit agent of the ai economy.” analysts describe it as the layer that ensures strategy alignment across protocols scalable and reliable. others liken wach’s verification cluster to a swarm of ai referees standing between chaos and order. and the wider web3 crowd acknowledges wach as the bridge between autonomous execution and trusted outcomes. the yapper leaderboard connection here’s the twist: wach isn’t just about infrastructure—it’s about mindshare. with the yapper leaderboard, wach is spotlighting the loudest, smartest voices shaping the ai agent economy. by yapping, educating, and spreading insights about wach ai, community members can earn recognition, rewards, and reputation. the future won’t just belong to those who build—it will belong to those who watch, verify, and explain."

2025-09-24 17:21:30+00:00,Tech,"the g7 and the eu are weighing new ways to chip away at china’s rare earths dominance. tariffs or taxes on chinese exports are on the table along with price floors and subsidies to jump start mining and processing capacity outside beijing’s reach. the thinking is that by raising costs on chinese supply, governments and industries will be forced to channel money into domestic or allied projects. over time, that could mean a more secure and diversified pipeline for minerals critical to defense, clean energy, and advanced tech. but the risks are hard to ignore. china controls close to 90% of the global rare earth market, and it has a track record of weaponizing exports when tensions rise. any new tariffs could invite retaliation, slower licensing, outright restrictions, or targeted disruptions that hit automakers, electronics, and magnet producers with higher costs and production delays. the ripple effects wouldn’t stop there, more expensive inputs could feed inflation and strain global supply chains. within the g7, there’s no single playbook. some countries want geographic sourcing limits or local content rules, others prefer cooperative purchasing agreements or subsidies without tariffs. everyone agrees on the stakes rare earths are too strategic to leave in one country’s grip but the path forward is messy. push too hard on taxes, and the risk is sparking a trade clash with beijing. move too softly, and the dependence deepens. the balance between resilience and retaliation is what the g7 is really trying to solve."

because most ai agents today live in a chat box. voice lowers friction and puts agents directly into high-volume workflows like customer service calls, field operations, and live team collaboration. embedding gemini in maestro also means those conversational agents can escalate, hand off, or trigger uipath workflows seamlessly. this expands the surface area for adoption and makes uipath relevant anywhere human-to-agent interaction happens. $snow snowflake cortex for agentic ai snowflake is a powerful partner because it already sits at the center of enterprise data. with its new cortex platform, snowflake can now run ai models securely inside its data perimeter. cortex search handles unstructured documents, cortex analyst translates natural language into sql for structured data, and cortex agents combine these into multi-step reasoning tasks. on their own, these cortex agents are great at retrieving and interpreting data, but they stop at the “answer” stage. by integrating with uipath maestro, those same cortex agents can trigger uipath automations to take action on the insight. a query like “show overdue claims with missing documentation” could start in cortex, but maestro then routes a uipath agent to automatically process, notify, or resolve those claims. snowflake ensures the data is accurate, governed, and secure, and uipath ensures the result actually impacts business workflows. that combination turns data + ai into measurable productivity gains. why i added today the pieces are clicking. maestro gives the platform spine. openai provides frontier reach and evaluation benchmarks. nvidia solves trust and sovereignty. google makes agents natural, real-time, and voice-native. snowflake grounds agentic ai in enterprise data and turns insights into action. this is exactly how you build an orchestration moat while the rest of the market still thinks in terms of bigger models. uipath is starting to look like the control plane for enterprise ai. we still need to see sales translate, but things look very positive and very bullish. it is getting closer to a conviction position. i will be taking deeper looks at this and sharing more dd in the days ahead."
