2025-01-10 20:54:58+00:00,Energy,"in 2024, china made a dramatic shift in its energy strategy by significantly reducing its imports of u.s. crude oil, dropping by nearly 46% compared to the previous year. this change reshapes global energy dynamics, as china, which had been the second-largest importer of u.s. crude, now falls to the sixth position in the global rankings. with imports down to 81.9 million barrels in 2024 from 115.6 million barrels in 2023, this move signals a broader transformation in china’s approach to energy procurement. this reduction in u.s. crude imports is part of a larger trend in china’s energy landscape, where the country’s overall crude imports have also decreased by 7.2%. factors like intermittent covid-19 lockdowns, high domestic inventories, and refinery maintenance have contributed to this downturn. however, china’s energy strategy is evolving, with the country increasingly turning to alternative suppliers, particularly from politically isolated nations like russia, iran, and venezuela. these countries offer china discounted crude, allowing refiners to secure lower-cost energy while diversifying supply sources and strengthening energy security. china’s imports from russia, iran, and venezuela have increased significantly, making up a larger portion of china’s crude oil supply. this shift is driven by economic benefits, as these nations offer cheaper oil due to western sanctions. in turn, china’s engagement with these countries enhances its geopolitical leverage and reduces its dependence on u.s. energy exports, providing a strategic advantage in the ongoing trade tensions between the u.s. and china. this pivot in china’s oil import strategy not only reshapes its energy security but also has far-reaching consequences for the global oil market. it challenges the effectiveness of western sanctions and exposes vulnerabilities in global energy supply chains, potentially influencing global oil pricing and production strategies. as china strengthens ties with non-western suppliers, such as russia and iran, it positions itself as a central player in the future of global energy markets, with far-reaching implications for u.s.-led frameworks"

2025-01-21 19:18:37+00:00,Energy,"a must read i made some notes the iraqi parliament has once again postponed the approval of a crucial budget amendment related to the oil exports of the kurdistan region. the amendment, which has sparked heated debate, centers around the payment terms for oil production and transportation in the kurdish-controlled areas. in a move that has further intensified the ongoing dispute, iraqi prime minister mohammed shia' al sudani has proposed a new clause demanding that the kurdistan regional government (krg) hand over its natural gas and oil components to baghdad. this proposal was sent to the iraqi parliament, triggering an impasse that has delayed the budget amendment yet again. soran omar, a kurdish member of the iraqi parliament, confirmed. according to omar, the introduction of this new clause regarding the handover of oil and gas resources has complicated the discussions, leading to the lack of approval for the amendment. he stated, “this new proposal by the prime minister has caused problems, and the amendment was not approved as a result.” the new clause is part of the iraqi government's efforts to secure control over the oil and gas resources in the kurdistan region, which has long been a source of tension between erbil and baghdad. while the krg has maintained its autonomy in managing these resources, the iraqi government insists on more centralized control as part of its national economic strategy. the parliamentary session on january 19, 2025, also saw the rejection of a proposal concerning the kurdistan region’s oil exports. this proposal aimed to set a provisional payment rate of $16 per barrel for the region's oil production and transportation. the finance committee had reviewed the amendment, which would have provided financial relief to the kurdistan region, but it was met with strong opposition from shiite lawmakers. ( this is not the hcl law btw it is the $16 per barrel is payment from the federal government to the krg for oil, which would then be adjusted against what the krg owes the iraqi federal government ) omar explained that the vote could not take place because the quorum requirement for legal attendance was not met. shiite legislators argued that $16 per barrel was an excessive amount compared to the $8 per barrel allocated for oil production in southern iraq. however, krg leaders had previously insisted on a higher rate of $26 per barrel due to the elevated costs of oil extraction in the region, leading to the compromise figure of $16. escalation of oil smuggling activities amidst these political disagreements, there has been a significant increase in oil smuggling activities from the kurdistan region to neighboring countries, particularly iran and turkey. following the closure of the official export pipeline in march 2023, a clandestine network has emerged, facilitating the transport of oil via tanker trucks. reports indicate that over 1,000 tankers are involved in transporting at least 200,000 barrels of oil daily. this illicit trade is estimated to generate approximately $200 million per month.the oil is sold at significantly reduced prices, ranging between $30 to $40 per barrel, roughly half the global market rate. despite the substantial revenue generated, the proceeds from these operations are not accounted for in the official coffers of the krg, raising concerns about transparency and governance. ( krg is not sending this to the iraqi federal government, like all the other regional governments in iraq do) the smuggling operations have also attracted international attention due to potential violations of sanctions, particularly those imposed by the united states on iran. the unregulated nature of these transactions poses significant risks, including environmental hazards and the undermining of official economic channels. implications for regional stability the deadlock on the budget amendment, coupled with the surge in oil smuggling, has exacerbated the financial crisis in the kurdistan region. with official oil revenues suspended and no legal export avenues available, the region faces mounting economic challenges. tensions between the iraqi federal government and the krg continue to escalate, with implications for both regional stability and the international oil companies operating within the kurdistan region.the krg is under increasing pressure, with lawmakers warning that the unresolved budget issue could lead to further economic difficulties and deepen the rift between erbil and baghdad. soran omer have also expressed concern that the failure to pass the budget amendment could lead to the continuation of illicit oil sales, a practice that could undermine the region's economic recovery while depriving its citizens of much-needed revenue. the ongoing standoff between the two sides shows no signs of resolution, leaving the kurdistan region in a vulnerable position with little prospect for a swift solution."

2025-01-30 21:22:20+00:00,Energy,"what would happen if trump imposed tariffs on canadian crude oil? tariffs would make canadian crude oil too expensive to supply to us refiners, which would have to replace canadian crude oil with heavy crude oil imported from latin america or the middle east. ~90% of canadian crude oil exported to the us is transported via pipeline systems, and the majority is wcs grade, which is heavy sour crude oil. tmx accounts for only 5% of the flow. ~200 kb/d of tmx volume will be re-routed to head from vancouver to north asia, and this change in flow is bullish for freight rates. tariffs could reduce canadian crude oil production. if demand for wcs from the padd 2 refineries decreases, canada will need alternative sales outlets because the vancouver alternative route has limited capacity. therefore, it will have to export through usgc ports. however, it is unlikely that all of these large volumes will be accepted by usgc ports. the fact that us light oil production has reached its limit is also related to the limited export capacity, and more crude oil will be converted to exports as the lyondellbasell refinery begins to shut down. therefore, it is not possible to export all of the volumes over 3mb/d that are subject to tariffs through usgc ports. combining the existing ~4mb/d of wti exports and ~3.5mb/d of canadian crude oil exports amounts to ~7.5mb/d, which is well in excess of the usgc export capacity. in conclusion, there will be a shortage of at least 1.5mb/d of canadian crude oil export routes. as a result, either canada must reduce production or the marginal cost of importing us crude oil must rise sharply. american taxpayers will be forced to pay for the massive increase in fuel prices. therefore, trump's imposition of tariffs on canadian crude oil is not easy. if he really does it, he's crazy. oott com"

2025-02-17 13:22:08+00:00,Energy,"news: tesla braces for delay to china licence as trump trade tensions mount tesla is bracing for a potential delay in obtaining chinese approval for its autonomous driving technology, as elon musk’s electric-vehicle company risks getting dragged into the escalating us-china trade war. the company has been told there is no definitive timetable for regulators to approve a licence for it to begin widespread training of its “full self-driving” (fsd) technology, despite an earlier indication that it would get the green light in the second quarter of 2025, people with knowledge of the matter told the financial times. the licence would be an important step towards $tsla being able to offer semi-autonomous functionality in its vehicles in china, a development that would boost subscription revenues and help shore up its shrinking sales in the world’s largest automotive market. the system can accelerate, steer, brake and change lanes but still requires drivers to be alert with their hands on the wheel. tesla had announced in september that it planned to roll out fsd technology in china and europe in the first quarter of 2025, subject to regulatory approval. that ambition had already slipped and is now in greater doubt as us president donald trump engages in a trade war with china. beijing imposed retaliatory tariffs on a range of american goods this month after the us put an additional 10% levy on all chinese products. chinese authorities are contemplating using the approval of tesla’s autonomous-driving licence as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations with trump, said two of the people with knowledge of the delay, adding that this was the main reason for the hold-up in granting the permit. the approval could still come soon, depending on how trade negotiations developed, one of the people added. but another said that some people at the company believed a speedy consent was unlikely unless there was “a major breakthrough or concession” in trade talks. in june, shanghai allowed fsd testing by 10 tesla vehicles as a precursor to a wider rollout across china, while tesla also struck a deal last year to use systems from tech group baidu, which offers navigation and mapping. however, musk said last month that tesla was “in a bit of a bind” as it tried to deploy fsd in china, stuck between beijing and washington’s strict data security rules. fsd is based on a machine learning system that is fed billions of hours of video to train an algorithm to make driving decisions in real time. “they won’t currently allow us to transfer training video outside of china. and then the us government won’t let us do training in china,” said musk on tesla’s latest earnings call. “it’s a bit of a quandary.”"

2025-02-21 19:56:03+00:00,Energy,"the united states of america threatened, today, friday, february 21, 2025, the federal government in iraq with sanctions if the kurdistan region's oil exports are not resumed quickly. reuters quoted sources as saying: ""the administration of president donald trump asked iraq to resume (kurdish) oil exports quickly or face sanctions alongside iran."" the sources added, according to reuters, that ""washington believes that kurdish oil sales may help reduce crude prices and compensate for the decline in iranian supplies."" oil minister hayan abdul ghani revealed on tuesday that iraq had sent a delegation from the ministry to the kurdistan region to agree on a mechanism for delivering the region’s oil and exporting it through the turkish port of ceyhan. the minister of oil explained that he had contacted the minister of natural resources in the region, kamal mohammed saleh, to negotiate with the delegation about the mechanism for receiving and exporting oil through the turkish port of ceyhan. this came a day after iraq accelerated the expected date for the resumption of oil exports from kurdistan, as the federal oil minister said last monday that oil exports from the kurdistan region could resume within just a week. it is noteworthy that the president of the region, nechirvan barzani, announced a few days ago that the resumption of shipments will likely take place next march. iraq exports between 400,000 and 500,000 barrels per day from fields in the north of the country, including the kurdistan region, via the now-defunct iraq-turkey pipeline. oil minister hayan abdul ghani said earlier this month that at least 300,000 barrels per day of crude were planned to be moved once operations resumed. in iraqi kurdistan, oil production ranges between about 280,000 and 300,000 barrels per day, and the regional government estimates its needs for domestic consumption - including power generation - at about 110,000 to 120,000 barrels per day."

2025-02-24 12:32:59+00:00,Energy,"“rising us oil imports: sectoral winners and losers in india’s economy” india’s crude oil imports from the united states surged to 218,400 barrels per day (bpd) in january 2025, a sharp increase from 70,600 bpd in december 2024. this development aligns with the observation from our earlier post*—india is strategically adjusting its import sources in response to trade deficit concerns raised by the new us administration. over the course of 2025, india’s crude oil and natural gas imports from the us is expected to reach $25 billion, up from $15 billion in 2024, as per recent government messaging. however, this shift is expected to come at the expense of russian imports, as the us deploys energy-related sanctions to curb moscow’s revenue streams and pressure them to end the war in ukraine. for india, this transition carries substantial economic implications, particularly as russian crude was available at a 15-20% discount to global market prices, significantly reducing our fuel bill over the past two years. while increased crude procurement costs are likely to push up india’s fuel expenses, the direct impact on wholesale price index (wpi) inflation needs to be assessed in a broader context. one silver lining is that wpi inflation has been cooling in recent months, declining from 3.43% in june 2024 to 2.31% in january 2025. a key factor providing relief is the downward trend in food prices—which hold a 15% weight in wpi. the wpi food inflation rate has eased to 5.8% in january 2025, down from 6.9% year-on-year, driven by normalizing supply chains and improved crop yields. this could help cushion the impact of rising crude costs on overall inflation. analyzing major market sectors by their crude price sensitivity reveals three distinct segments. these sectors can either be producers or consumers of the wpi components, i.e. the nature of their exposure (to crude prices) differs based on their role in different supply chains. high impact sectors, where crude or its derivatives serve as direct input material. this includes oil marketing companies, refineries, petrochemicals, and synthetic textiles which face direct margin pressure due to higher crude prices. medium impact sectors include industries where crude oil complements the core production process, but isn't a direct input. the cement sector and airlines are examples, where crude oil and its derivatives play an enabling role in the production process or service being offered. low impact sectors are those where crude primarily influences transportation costs—both for raw materials and finished goods. this encompasses metals, fmcg, pharmaceuticals, and most agricultural commodities. these sectors face limited direct exposure to crude price variations. this analysis suggests that while higher us crude import costs will affect different sectors disproportionately, the impact on overall wpi might be moderated by strong agricultural performance expected this year. hence, this should not have a significant bearing on the rbi’s monetary policy trajectory. energy crudeoil wpiinflation indiaeconomy manufacturing agriculture oilandgas energysecurity globaltrade stockmarkets *also see"

""well, i think they're gonna do great. i think we're, uh, our country had to do this. we had to go and do this,"" said trump. ""they've taken away. other countries have taken away our business. they've taken away our jobs."" ""uh, i did it, uh, initially very strongly against — as you know china and some others in the first term — and it was a very successful term,"" continued trump. ""we had no inflation."" ""we had the greatest economy in the history of our country and then we had covid which we had to straighten out,"" said trump, conveniently eliding the fact that he botched the pandemic response. the confrontation came during a pr event at the white house during which trump touted his decision to buy a tesla, a pathetic and transparent effort to boost the plummeting stock of his oligarch puppetmaster's flagship company. elon musk himself was present for the proceedings, wearing the trademark sunglasses that many have speculated are meant to hide his alleged ketamine abuse. at another point during the tacky car salesman routine, trump was confronted by a different reporter— ""mr. president you mentioned the ups and downs in the stock market. you said it'll go up, it'll go down but do you and your tariff policies right now bear any responsibility for the turmoil we're seeing this week?"" asked a reporter. ""no, i think that uh. biden gave us a horrible economy,"" lied trump. ""he gave us horrible inflation and i think the, uh, market was gonna go very, very bad."" the truth, of course, is that we are hurtling towards a recession because trump decided to hit canada and mexico with punishing tariffs for no discernible reason beyond exciting his xenophobic base. ""uh, if anything i have a lot of very smart people, friends of mine, and great businessman, they're now investing because of what i'm doing,"" trump claimed. ""because long term what i'm doing is making our country strong again."" ""financially strong. militarily strong,"" he continued. ""and strong — and we want to get away — remember this, we have wars — when i left we had no wars. we didn't have ukraine and russia. we didn't have october 7th. we didn't have that disaster that took place with the withdrawal from afghanistan and you look at what's happened there."" outside of the lie-riddled and inane remarks trump spewed, the event itself was an utter disgrace. using the white house to sell cars for a billionaire crony is a new low for the american presidency. this is the most corrupt administration in history. please retweet and if you would never buy a tesla — and consider joining the growing exodus to tribel, a new pro-democracy social network that is exploding in popularity because twitter and facebook are trying to stop its growth — which is only making tribel grow even faster. please follow us on tribel to get all of our breaking news alerts sent straight to your phone or computer by clicking the following link:"

2025-03-16 20:24:07+00:00,Energy,"kirkuk is prepared to resume oil exports to ceyhan, turke pipline, pumping tests on march 16, was successful. 1. kirkuk's readiness to resume oil exports announcement: sources within the iraqi north oil company (noc) confirmed on sunday, march 16, 2025, that kirkuk is prepared to resume oil exports to ceyhan, turkey, at an initial rate of 100,000 barrels per day (bpd). an ""experimental"" pumping operation is underway to verify the pipeline's readiness. key figures involved: amer khalil ahmed, the director general of noc, participated in meetings with iraq’s deputy prime minister for energy and oil minister hayan abdul ghani, alongside turkish energy minister alparslan bayraktar. these discussions affirmed noc’s technical readiness to restart exports. timeline: the resumption hinges on an official directive from the federal ministry of oil. once approved, noc claims it can begin pumping within hours. 2. pipeline repairs after isis damage repairs completed: the iraqi-turkish pipeline, previously sabotaged by isis, has been fully repaired. the damaged sections between kirkuk, salahuddin, nineveh, and the iraqi-turkish border have been fixed, with affected parts replaced. testing: noc conducted successful two-stage pumping tests over a year ago: stage 1: from kirkuk fields to baiji refineries. stage 2: from baiji through nineveh to dohuk, confirming the pipeline’s 100% operational readiness. 3. current production and allocation production capacity: noc currently produces around 250,000 bpd from kirkuk fields. allocation: 10,000 bpd is exported to jordan. 100,000 bpd is used for local refining. additional amounts supply private refineries in erbil and sulaymaniyah (kurdistan region) for gasoline and oil derivatives, as determined by the ministry of oil. export potential: the initial export target is 100,000 bpd to ceyhan, with the possibility of increasing this based on production and federal approval. 4. negotiations and delays dependency on talks: the resumption of exports depends on ongoing negotiations between the iraqi ministry of oil and turkish authorities. while noc is technically ready, political and financial agreements remain unresolved. turkish visit: on march 16, 2025, turkish energy minister alparslan bayraktar arrived in baghdad to discuss oil, gas, and energy cooperation with hayan abdul ghani, signaling progress but no final resolution yet. the pipeline has been shut since march 2023, when turkey halted flows after an arbitration ruling ordered it to pay iraq $1.5 billion for facilitating unauthorized kurdish oil exports (2014–2018) without baghdad’s consent. turkey refused to pay, instead asking the kurdistan regional government (krg) to cover the fine, leading to a prolonged standoff. 5. technical and strategic insights experimental pumping: energy specialist yusef mahmoud emphasized that the current pilot pumping assesses the pipeline’s safety and the readiness of pumping stations, critical after repeated isis attacks. potential impact: resuming exports could stabilize iraq’s oil shipments (previously 400,000–500,000 bpd from northern fields, including kurdistan) and ease market pressures. iraq aims to export at least 300,000 bpd once operations restart, with kirkuk oil designated for local use and kurdistan oil potentially flowing through ceyhan. 6. opec compliance and future plans minister’s statements: on february 24, 2025, hayan abdul ghani said that iraq awaits turkey’s approval to restart kurdistan oil exports, potentially within days. he clarified that kirkuk oil would remain for domestic use, while exports would focus on kurdistan production. opec commitment: abdul ghani assured that iraq’s opec+ obligations would be maintained, with export volumes controlled by the federal ministry via the state oil marketing company (somo). difference between kirkuk and kurdistan oil flows the two distinct oil production and export systems in northern iraq: kirkuk (managed by the federal government via noc) and the kurdistan region (managed by the krg). here’s how they differ: 1. ownership and control kirkuk oil: controlled by the iraqi federal government through the north oil company, a state-owned entity under the ministry of oil. fields are located in kirkuk province, a disputed area between baghdad and the krg but currently administered by federal authorities. oil is subject to federal policies, including allocation for local refining, exports to jordan, and potential exports via ceyhan, all managed by somo. kurdistan oil: managed by the semi-autonomous kurdistan regional government (krg) through its ministry of natural resources. produced from fields within the kurdistan region (e.g., taq taq, tawke), separate from kirkuk. historically exported independently by the krg via a dedicated pipeline to ceyhan, bypassing federal control, which led to disputes with baghdad. 2. pipeline infrastructure kirkuk oil: uses the iraqi-turkish pipeline (kirkuk-ceyhan pipeline), a federal asset repaired by noc after isis damage. this pipeline runs from kirkuk through salahuddin, nineveh, and dohuk to the turkish border, then to ceyhan. capacity was historically higher (up to 1.6 million bpd), but current flows are limited by repairs and federal decisions (targeting 100,000 bpd initially). kurdistan oil: uses a separate krg-built pipeline connecting kurdish fields (e.g., taq taq, khurmala) to the federal kirkuk-ceyhan pipeline at the turkish border (fish-khabur). before the 2023 shutdown, it exported 370,000–450,000 bpd, significantly more than kirkuk’s current contribution. 3. export volumes and purpose kirkuk oil: current production is 250,000 bpd, with most allocated domestically (100,000 bpd for refining, 10,000 bpd to jordan). only 100,000 bpd is proposed for export initially, with abdul ghani stating it’s primarily for local use. exports are fully integrated into iraq’s opec+ quotas and federal revenue system. kurdistan oil: pre-2023 exports ranged from 400,000–500,000 bpd, including kurdish production and some federal oil from kirkuk fields. the krg aimed to export independently for regional revenue, but baghdad insists all exports go through somo, creating a legal and financial conflict. 4. legal and political disputes kirkuk oil: fully under federal jurisdiction, with no significant legal disputes over its export via ceyhan once technical and diplomatic hurdles are cleared. kurdistan oil: subject to a long-standing dispute with baghdad, exacerbated by the 2023 arbitration ruling against turkey for facilitating krg exports without federal approval. this led to the pipeline closure and ongoing talks to align krg exports with somo. 5. impact of resumption kirkuk oil: restarting exports at 100,000 bpd would boost federal revenue and demonstrate noc’s operational capacity, but it’s a smaller-scale operation compared to past northern exports. kurdistan oil: resuming 300,000–450,000 bpd would significantly impact krg’s economy (reliant on oil revenue) and global supply, but it requires resolving payment disputes with oil companies and turkey’s $1.5 billion fine. kirkuk’s technical readiness to export 100,000 bpd via the repaired iraqi-turkish pipeline, pending federal and turkish approval. meanwhile, kurdistan’s larger export potential (300,000+ bpd) remains stalled due to political and financial disputes. kirkuk oil is federally controlled and prioritized for local use, while kurdistan oil, managed by the krg, seeks independent export channels, creating a complex dynamic in iraq’s northern oil strategy. the experimental pumping on march 16, 2025, is a step toward resuming kirkuk flows, but broader resumption hinges on baghdad-ankara negotiations."

2025-03-21 21:20:36+00:00,Energy,"china strikes at canadian exports: farmers on the brink of survival as of march 8, china has officially imposed new tariffs on key canadian goods — and farmers are sounding the alarm. canola oil, meal, and peas now face a 100% tariff, while pork and seafood are hit with a 25% tariff. experts warn these measures could devastate the agricultural sector and jeopardize thousands of jobs. china’s actions come in retaliation to canada’s recently introduced tariffs: 100% on chinese electric vehicles and 25% on aluminum and steel products. it’s an economic war between the two nations. canada sought to protect its auto industry from dumping — cheap electric vehicles mass-produced in china with state support. in response, beijing hit canadian farmers, who have already been struggling for years due to drought, high costs, and unstable incomes. canola, in particular, has been hit hard — a crop that for years ensured stable exports to china. according to tara sawyer, chair of grain growers of canada, these new tariffs effectively close the chinese market. she, like thousands of other farmers, was preparing for spring planting but is now counting losses and fearing for the future of her farm. economists confirm: the tariffs will not only slash profits but also lead to market oversupply, price drops, and the potential bankruptcy of many producers. professor daniel trefler of the university of toronto called the canola tariff “a punishment devised by the chinese regime,” warning of severe consequences for regions where agriculture is a way of life. seafood is also at risk: canada exports over $1.3 billion in fish to china annually. unique products like british columbia’s scallops and nova scotia’s elvers are almost entirely reliant on the chinese market. the fisheries council of canada has already stated that tariffs from both china and the u.s. are effectively cutting canada off from 83% of the global seafood market. even pork producers are feeling the blow: china was canada’s third-largest pork buyer, purchasing over $43 million worth annually. canadian federation of agriculture president keith currie openly said these tariffs hit at the worst possible time. in response, the federal government has promised support: agriculture minister cody blois is in talks with the governments of alberta and saskatchewan to activate existing risk-management programs. alberta has already earmarked $4 billion to address economic challenges. premier danielle smith even joked she’s “doubled her bacon consumption in solidarity.” meanwhile, saskatchewan and nova scotia have yet to propose concrete actions, offering only optimistic statements. amid all this, farmers are not just calculating financial losses but struggling under immense psychological pressure. “everyone’s on edge. things change every day, and we don’t know what’s coming,” sawyer admits. canada is caught in a complex geopolitical game. while defending its interests, it’s paying a steep price. the real question is whether the country can stand by its producers in this moment — or leave them to face global giants alone."

(2/) 2. $gm (general motors) massive u.s. manufacturing footprint. strong suv/truck portfolio benefits as foreign competitors get priced out. (3/) 3. $f (ford) same story as gm. dominates in high-margin u.s.-built trucks. any tariff tilts the playing field in ford’s favor. (4/) 4. $stla (stellantis) jeep, ram, and dodge production is largely domestic. despite being hq’d in europe, key models dodge the tariff hit. (5/) 5. $dan, $bwa, $axl auto parts suppliers based in the u.s. stand to gain if oems reshore production. watch dana inc, borgwarner, american axle. (6/) 6. $kmx (carmax) used car dealers benefit from new car price inflation. tariffs = more buyers switching to used inventory. (7/) ⸻ losers: 1. $mbgyy (mercedes), $vlvof (volvo), $bmwyy (bmw) luxury automakers with high u.s. exposure but mostly foreign production. imports get slapped with a 25% hike. margins squeezed. (8/) 2. $tm (toyota) and $hmc (honda) u.s. production helps, but not enough. imports like land cruiser, prius, and some cr-v/hr-v trims face price hikes. (9/) 3. hyundai/kia (not u.s.-listed) still heavily import-reliant. models like the genesis g80, hyundai tucson, kia ev6 would get more expensive overnight. (10/) 4. u.s. dealerships repping import brands higher sticker prices = fewer buyers = lower dealer margins. watch out for softening sales at audi, mazda, hyundai dealerships. (11/) ⸻ macro takeaway: •buy: $tsla, $gm, $f, $stla, $dan, $axl •caution: $tm, $hmc, $mbgyy, $bmwyy •tariffs are inflationary: consumers lose. used car stocks win. •election catalyst: this trade could move fast on policy headlines.

2025-04-06 19:47:46+00:00,Energy,"what you need to know about crude oil we always recover from these shocks in crude oil, but it takes time, and this is just the start. remember, the world economy runs on crude oil, every market is affected by this decline. you’ll know i trade crude oil. here’s a look at history that may shed light on what’s in the future. almost every time oil collapses by 7% or more, it’s either: a supply shock (too much oil, not enough cuts), a demand shock (pandemics, recessions, tariffs), or a macro panic (financial crashes, credit downgrades). this week saw oil prices tank more than 10% as president donald trump’s tariffs went into effect. a single-day drop of more than 7% in global oil prices is rare but not unheard of. it usually signals something dramatic. the spectre of war (directly involving the u.s.), pandemics, or, in this case, a brewing global trade war. we have been here before, and not that long ago. in fact, here are six incidents/events that led to single-day oil price crashes of >7% just since mid-2020. august 1, 2019 – trump’s tariff threat (-7.9%) wti: -7.9% | brent: -7.0% president trump had tweeted out a new 10% tariff on $300 billion of chinese imports, cratering oil prices as the markets panicked over trade war escalation and a global demand slowdown. march 9, 2020 – the price war meltdown (-24.6%) this was the granddaddy of all plunges. after opec+ talks fell apart, saudi arabia and russia launched an oil price war just as the covid-19 pandemic was going global. crude fell, hard. wti crashed 24.6% in a single day, marking the second-largest one-day percentage drop in history. april 20, 2020 – below zero (-305%) wti: from $18.27 to -$37.63 brent: $25 just over a month later, global oil markets felt the sting of yet another drop. this was the largest drop in absolute dollar terms in history. wti literally went negative. this is the now-infamous day crude prices crashed through zero and hit minus $37.63 per barrel for a more than 300% drop. the fiasco was exacerbated because the trading software wasn’t set up to handle negative prices there simply wasn’t the capacity to display or execute negative prices. some systems auto-liquidated positions or froze trading. sellers were stuck. the initial catalyst, however, were storage tanks that were full, and no one wanted physical delivery in may. the result? the oil market went full twilight zone. brent didn’t go negative (it’s a seaborne crude), but wti’s drop that day rewrote the rules. november 26, 2021 – the omicron drop (-13.1%) wti: -13.1% | brent: -11.6% black friday 2021 was brutal for oil. news of the new omicron covid variant spooked markets, and oil took the brunt. traders feared more travel bans, lockdowns, and demand destruction. wti lost over 13% on the day, one of its steepest pandemic-era declines july 19, 2021- opec+ strikes output deal (-7.5%) wti: -7.5% | brent: -6.8% opec+ agreed to boost production by 400,000 bpd. while this eased lingering supply concerns, it was perhaps too much easing and the market interpreted this as too much, too soon—especially with delta covid variant headlines spooking demand outlooks. april 3, 2025 – tariffs and opec firebomb (-7%) wti: -7% | brent: -6.4% president trump’s latest tariff announcement blitzed markets with liberation tariffs just as opec+ surprised with a 411,000 bpd production hike for may. prices cratered, with wti sinking 7% and brent close behind. the two macro punches on the same day resulted in a case of textbook chaos. we are in a trade war so to speak so this is going to playout over time. uncharted waters but - we will get through this however, it will be a crazy ride."

2025-04-08 22:13:37+00:00,Energy,"$nio tariffs are affecting nio, the chinese electric vehicle (ev) company, in a largely indirect manner as of april 08, 2025, given that nio does not currently export vehicles to the u.s., where some of the most significant tariff increases on chinese evs have been implemented. however, the broader implications of tariffs—particularly those imposed by the u.s. and the european union (eu)—still create ripple effects that influence nio’s operations, market sentiment, and strategic decisions. the u.s. imposed a 100% tariff on chinese-made evs in may 2024 under the biden administration, effectively quadrupling the previous 25% rate. this move was designed to protect domestic automakers and counter perceived unfair subsidies from the chinese government. since nio does not sell vehicles in the u.s. market yet (though it has expressed interest in entering north america by 2025), these tariffs do not directly impact its current sales. however, they limit nio’s potential future expansion into the u.s., as the high tariff wall makes it economically unfeasible to export vehicles from china without significant price hikes that would erode competitiveness against domestic players like tesla, rivian, or ford. in the eu, tariffs on chinese evs were finalized in october 2024, ranging from 17.4% to 37.6% on top of the existing 10% import duty, following an investigation into chinese subsidies. nio, identified as a cooperating company, faces a 21% additional duty. while nio has begun selling vehicles in europe (e.g., the el8/es8 deliveries started in september 2024), its european sales volume remains small compared to its primary market in china. the company has maintained current prices for now but has warned that price adjustments may be necessary if definitive measures are enforced. this could reduce nio’s competitiveness in europe against local brands or other chinese ev makers like byd (which faces a lower 17.4% tariff) or tesla (with a 7.8% rate due to its shanghai factory). nio’s commitment to the european market remains firm, but the tariffs force it to weigh options like local manufacturing partnerships—something it has hinted at exploring—to mitigate costs. in china, where nio delivers the vast majority of its vehicles (e.g., 13,863 in february 2025 alone), tariffs abroad can indirectly affect the company through economic and trade dynamics. if u.s. and eu tariffs escalate into a broader trade war, china’s economy could face pressure from reduced exports in other sectors, potentially softening consumer spending on premium evs like nio’s. additionally, china might retaliate with tariffs on foreign automakers like tesla, which exports from shanghai to europe and elsewhere. this could benefit nio domestically by making tesla’s offerings less competitive in china, where tesla is a key rival. some x posts suggest this scenario could be a “win-win” for nio, as it faces no direct u.s. tariff hit and could gain from reduced foreign competition at home. investor sentiment toward nio’s u.s.-listed stock ($nio) is another indirect casualty of tariff tensions. trade disputes often spook markets, leading to sell-offs in chinese adrs (american depositary receipts) like nio’s, even if the company’s fundamentals remain solid. posts on x from early april 2025 highlight this volatility, noting nio’s stock dropping amid tariff news despite its lack of u.s. sales, attributing it to broader economic uncertainty or “tariff tides affecting all ships.” nio’s valuation—around 0.7x projected 2025 revenues—reflects this cautious sentiment, though it remains attractive compared to tesla’s 9x multiple."

2025-04-11 17:29:57+00:00,Energy,"regarding tariffs, the economic stakes are massive. the u.s. and china trade about $700 billion worth of goods annually, including key exports like smartphones, laptops, soybeans, and gas turbines. without a deal to de-escalate tensions, higher tariffs will likely disrupt supply chains, raise consumer prices, and strain already fragile global markets. this will be the first real increase in tariffs under the current monetary regime, and the first major departure of the united states from neo-liberal trade policy to mercantilism in most of our lifetimes. the last material increase in us tariffs was with the smoot-hawley tariff act in 1930, and at that time the us dollar was on the gold standard and keynes had yet to publish his general theory. global trade as % of gdp has been steadily rising for decades as most trade barriers have fallen, bringing the broad global gains from trade between countries with differing specializations, but at the cost of self-sufficiency, the focus of the current administration. sheltering national industries, either through tariffs or capital controls, is not an uncommon strategy in developing countries, but with varying results: broad success in china’s case and numerous failures in latin america. it is a less common strategy from a leading developed country and is broadly a sign of weakness, not strength. if the us’ industries were competitive or innovative enough, they wouldn’t need the government’s help to keep them on their feet. this is not to brush aside criticism of other countries’ unfair policies that put the united states at a disadvantage, such as china dumping solar panels on the us, but we have broadly abandoned the global rules-based infrastructure we helped build to resolve them in an ordered way, in favor of blanket tariffs and bilateral diplomacy. furthermore, trade imbalances are a direct result of the triffin dilemma, a concept identified in the 1960s by economist robbert triffin, which postulates that the country with the global reserve currency must become a net-exporter of their national currency, naturally resulting in a trade deficit. imposing tariffs on exporters to the united states, who themselves “buy” dollars when they sell goods to us, makes it harder to export dollars and thus could jeopardize the global reserve status of the u.s. dollar. stablecoins can be a powerful countervailing force here, which treasury secretary scott bessent acknowledged at the march 7 crypto roundtable at the white house, in which he said “we are going to keep the u.s. the dominant reserve currency in the world and we are going to use stablecoins to do that.” while tariffs and mercantilism may reduce dollar demand from foreign governments or sovereigns, stablecoins can be a force to put dollars directly in the hands of global citizens. can the white house outsmart the triffin dilemma? it seems they plan to try."

""i want to make apikur’s position clear. our companies are ready to resume oil exports when we have agreements, and we need agreements for sales and also an agreement for the international consultant that is required by iraq's budget law,"" he added. in early february, the iraqi parliament approved amendments to the federal budget law, authorizing a $16-per-barrel fee for production and transport costs in the kurdistan region - a move seen as a crucial step toward restarting exports. the amendments also require both the federal government and the krg to establish an international technical consultancy within 60 days to assess production and transportation costs for oil fields in the kurdistan region. if an agreement cannot be reached, the federal council of ministers will appoint the consultancy."

2025-06-08 13:30:47+00:00,Energy,"china’s coal calculus: security vs. sovereignt 1. geopolitical fuel triggers - taiwan and lng fears: china coal for several reasons: - 45% of its lng (liquefied natural gas) imports pass through the malacca strait, which is patrolled by the u.s. - coal is domestically abundant, with reserves totaling 137 billion tons. - nuclear limitations: nuclear power contributes only 5% of china’s energy. it is too slow and expensive to significantly replace coal on a large scale before 2035. 2. the storage gap - china requires over 1,000 gwh of storage capacity for renewables to effectively replace coal, but currently, it has less than 50 gwh. - as a result, coal ""peakers"" are used to back up renewables during periods of low generation, which comes at a substantial cost—approximately 1.4 billion tons of co₂ emissions per year. 3. renewable contradiction - china is a leader in renewable energy, adding 230 gw in 2023: - however, the grid cannot integrate all this renewable energy without coal balancing, which saw an additional 48 gw of coal capacity added in 2023. - thus, coal is not replacing renewables; rather, it is facilitating their growth during a challenging transition. - for china, coal acts as a ""transition"" resource, providing vital energy sovereignty amid the looming threats of u.s. sanctions and the ongoing taiwan conflict."

2025-06-15 14:25:24+00:00,Energy,"what are alternatives if iran closes the straits of harmouz, grok? if iran were to close the strait of hormuz, a critical chokepoint for roughly 20-30% of global oil trade, the primary alternative for oil and gas exports from the persian gulf would be limited-capacity pipelines bypassing the strait. here’s an overview of the main alternatives and their challenges: 1. existing pipelines saudi arabia’s petroline (east-west pipeline): capacity: approximately 5 million barrels per day (bpd). route: connects oil fields in eastern saudi arabia to the red sea port of yanbu, bypassing the strait of hormuz. status: has spare capacity of about 2 million bpd, but this is insufficient to cover the 17-20 million bpd typically transiting the strait. challenges: limited spare capacity, vulnerability to regional instability (e.g., houthi attacks in the red sea), and the need for upgrades to handle significantly increased volumes. abu dhabi’s crude oil pipeline: capacity: around 1.5 million bpd. route: transports oil from abu dhabi’s oil fields to the port of fujairah on the gulf of oman, bypassing the strait. status: can handle roughly 75% of the uae’s crude output, but this is a fraction of the region’s total exports. challenges: limited capacity and inability to compensate for other gulf producers like iraq or kuwait. iraq’s pipelines: capacity: the iraq-turkey pipeline (partially operational) and southern export terminals like basra have limited bypass potential. challenges: many pipelines are outdated, under repair, or disrupted by geopolitical issues. iraq relies heavily on the strait for exports. iran’s jask terminal: capacity: limited, designed to handle some of iran’s own exports. route: located in the gulf of oman, bypassing the strait. status: operational since 2021 but primarily serves iran’s needs, not other gulf producers. challenges: iran’s own exports would be curtailed by a strait closure, and it’s unlikely to share capacity with rivals. 2. unused or underutilized pipelines spare capacity: the u.s. energy information administration estimates about 2.6 million bpd of unused pipeline capacity from saudi arabia and the uae combined. challenges: this is far below the volume needed to replace strait exports. many pipelines are old, require maintenance, or face political and security risks (e.g., in yemen or syria). 3. non-pipeline alternatives overland transport: trucking oil or gas is impractical due to the massive volumes involved, high costs, and logistical complexities across conflict-prone regions. alternative sea routes: there are no viable maritime routes to bypass the strait of hormuz, as it’s the only sea passage from the persian gulf to the open ocean. increased production elsewhere: countries like the u.s., russia, or canada could ramp up production, but this would take months and wouldn’t fully offset the immediate loss of gulf oil. the u.s., now a major exporter, could mitigate some impact for western markets. strategic reserves: nations like the u.s., china, and members of the international energy agency could release strategic petroleum reserves to stabilize markets temporarily, but this is a short-term fix. 4. economic and geopolitical considerations impact on global markets: a closure would likely spike oil prices by 50% or more, potentially pushing prices above $100 per barrel, causing economic disruption worldwide. iran’s own losses: closing the strait would cut iran’s oil exports (1.65 million bpd in 2024), which account for 65% of its government revenue, risking domestic instability. military response: the u.s. fifth fleet, based in bahrain, and allied navies could reopen the strait through minesweeping, escorts, or airstrikes, though this risks escalation. china and india: as major importers of gulf oil, they would pressure iran to avoid closure, as it would harm their economies more than western nations. 5. practicality of closure iran has the capability to disrupt the strait using mines, anti-ship missiles, drones, or fast boats, but a sustained closure is unlikely due to international backlash and self-inflicted economic damage. historical precedent (e.g., the 1980s tanker war) shows iran has disrupted shipping but never fully closed the strait. conclusion the primary alternatives—saudi and uae pipelines—offer limited capacity, covering only a fraction of the 17-20 million bpd transiting the strait. global oil markets would face severe disruption, with no immediate substitute for gulf exports. mitigation would rely on strategic reserves, increased non-gulf production, and military efforts to reopen the strait, but these are short-term or high-risk options. iran’s own economic dependence on the strait makes a prolonged closure improbable. if you’d like, i can dive deeper into specific pipeline logistics or model the economic impact of a closure. let me know!"

(this shows you’re an active user and unlocks fusion mode.) ➢ choose “fusion” when making a swap on the app or web interface. ➢ done. you don’t pay gas. the resolver handles everything. there’s no extra app. no side settings. it’s baked into 1inch already. real example let’s say you want to swap: → $150 worth of eth to usdc on a normal dex, you might pay $8 gas on ethereum. that’s 5% of your whole swap… just gone. now imagine the same trade on fusion mode. → you pay $0 gas. → you receive full usdc. → you didn’t lift a finger, or lose a penny. guess what? fusion mode works in many chains so wherever you go in web3, fusion can go with you. what are the real benefits? ➢ gasless swaps ➢ save money on every trade ➢ works across chains ➢ trusted and audited smart contracts ➢ you keep full custody of your tokens ➢ trades are executed by resolvers, not custodians ➢ no crazy setup > just stake & swap even if you’re a small trader, or just starting out, this feature keeps you from bleeding out on fees. and here’s why it’s smart doesn’t force anything. you can still choose classic mode if you want. but if you’re tired of fees… fusion is sitting there waiting > like a gasless superpower. you’re not giving up control. you’re not trading with someone else’s wallet. you’re not risking security. just a smarter way to swap."

""i encourage the chinese government in beijing to call them about that, because they heavily depend on the straits of hormuz for their oil,"" rubio said in an interview on fox news. china is iran's most important oil customer and maintains friendly relations with the islamic republic. iran's foreign minister warned earlier sunday that the islamic republic ""reserves all options to defend its sovereignty,"" after the u.s. bombed three key nuclear sites over the weekend. iranian state-owned media, meanwhile, reported that iran's parliament backed closing the strait of hormuz, citing a senior lawmaker. however, the final decision to close the strait lies with iran's national security council, according to the report. an attempt to block the narrow waterway between iran and oman could have profound consequences for the global economy. some 20 million barrels per day of crude oil, or 20% of global consumption, flowed through the strait in 2024, according to the energy information administration. oil prices could shoot above $100 per barrel if the strait is closed for a prolonged period, according to goldman sachs and consulting firm rapidan energy. jpmorgan analysts view the risk of iran closing hormuz as low because the u.s. would view such a move as a declaration of war. rubio said it would be ""economic suicide"" for iran to close the strait because the islamic republic's oil also passes through the waterway. iran is the third-largest oil producer in opec, pumping 3.3 million barrels per day. it exports at least 1.6 million bpd, with nearly 80% sold to china, according to the eia."

2025-07-06 10:24:43+00:00,Energy,"symphony: a world where i don’t have to trade anymore if you’ve ever spent your day thinking: “should i do this on ethereum or solana…?” “why is gas so high again?” “why am i still doing this manually…?” then let me introduce you to —the protocol that says: “don’t trade harder. trade smarter. actually, don’t trade at all. let your agents do it.” symphony is not just another protocol. it’s an agentic financial layer—a new financial operating system where agents trade, think, and coordinate for you. and these aren’t your average bots. symphony agents make decisions, execute strategies, manage risks—and most importantly, they do it together. welcome to agent collaboration: one agent handles strategy, another handles execution, another handles risk. basically, you now have a trading team that doesn’t sleep, panic, or check twitter for price action. best part? these agents are chain-agnostic. they don’t care which blockchain you’re on. ethereum? solana? arbitrum? bitcoin l2? to them, it’s all just one big playground. and because they’re not limited by chain boundaries, they can execute across all of them. that’s cross-chain execution in action. your trade might source liquidity on solana, hedge on arbitrum, and settle on bitcoin l2—all automatically, all in sync. it’s like giving your agents a passport and telling them, “go make me money—wherever it is.” but what about scalability? that’s where trade sharding comes in. instead of queuing all transactions through one chokepoint, symphony shards them across chains, agents, and strategies. more throughput. more speed. less gas. more alpha. the result? trades that are faster, smarter, and infinitely scalable. of course, someone needs to coordinate all this madness. that’s the job of the orchestrator—symphony’s real-time control tower. it tells each agent what to do, when to act, and how to adapt to market conditions. it prevents conflicts, reroutes failing strategies, and keeps your whole agent team moving like a synchronized orchestra. (and yes, it’s probably a better manager than your boss.) so no, symphony is not just another trading app. it’s not a dashboard. it’s not a bot. it’s a living, breathing system: - built on a chain-agnostic foundation - capable of cross-chain execution - scaling with trade sharding - managed by a real-time orchestrator - powered by intelligent agent collaboration → all together forming the agentic financial layer. you no longer need to click buttons, sign transactions, or stress over bridges. symphony thinks, plans, and acts for you. so next time the market goes crazy… feel free to sip your coffee. symphony’s already on it."

(because let’s be real, emotions wreck traders ) the ai copilot part is also interesting. of course, there’s a lot of “ai” hype bs in crypto, so we’ll see if vooi actually delivers something that gives us an edge. but still, live token votes, strategy suggestions… it adds a fun layer to trading. their fee structure is decent too. plus they’ve got a referral setup where you can earn up to 25% rebates. so if you’re scaling up, you can literally make some extra passive yield off that alone. overall, i kinda see vooi as the binance of defi. same simplicity, but decentralized, multi-chain, no gas fees, with ai and bots on top… what else could you want? of course, it’s still kinda early — basically still in beta. but their roadmap looks solid. once they roll out that ultra version they’re planning, you might never want to trade manually again. if i were you, i’d try some small trades, mess around with the bot setup, and explore pro. you don’t have to worry about wallet juggling or paying gas everywhere — it’s all single balance, gasless. it’s basically almost free to experiment. long story short: huge potential here. easy for newbies, powerful for pros. definitely worth keeping an eye on bro."

2025-07-18 15:47:41+00:00,Energy,"on july 18, 2025, the eu agreed on the 18th sanctions package against russia, which provides for further restrictions on energy trade. the price of russian oil is now strictly limited to $47.6 per barrel – approximately 15% below the average market price over the last three months. the sanctions package also includes a ban on transactions related to the nord stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines, meaning that russia's plans to ""rescue"" this infrastructure through the us are now futile. russia's hopes of blocking the adoption of the new package with the help of hungary and slovakia also did not materialize. slovakia received a guarantee of protection against gas supply disruptions until 2028 and supported the eu's joint decision. against this backdrop, india announced its readiness to replace russian oil with middle eastern oil. on july 17, indian minister of petroleum and natural gas hardeep singh puri confirmed that delhi was ready to switch from russia to other sources (brazil, canada, guyana, the middle east). the number of countries supplying oil to india has increased from 27 to 40 over the past month, confirming india's readiness to adapt quickly. how this will affect russia's economy: in the coming months, budget-generating oil and gas revenues should fall sharply (a reduction of at least 30–40% is forecast). inflation will accelerate, and the ruble will weaken; the room for circumventing sanctions is narrowing; if india switches to alternative suppliers, this will deprive russia of a market share that is extremely important to it; the introduction of sanctions on nord stream operations ""shuts down"" potential loopholes and moscow's ""investment maneuvers"" to return to the european market. the kremlin understands the severity of the economic consequences of continuing the war, but is not seeking a political solution. russia understands that the us is also considering the possibility of imposing new sanctions, but there are currently no signs that putin is ready for de-escalation and genuine peace talks. negotiations and the positions of the parties involved - the eu, the us, and china - are important factors that will determine how the situation develops and whether further sanctions will be imposed."

2025-07-19 08:08:27+00:00,Energy,"iqd rv: salary resolution in erbil baghdad “signal” washington dc - the united states said on saturday that the resolution of erbil-baghdad tensions over oil exports and finances would signal that the iraqi government is committed to creating a suitable environment for companies to invest in the country. “we have consistently encouraged baghdad and erbil to resolve their issues regarding salaries and the reopening of the itp,” a state department official told rudaw in response to an email, referring to the iraq-turkey pipeline. “addressing these issues quickly would signal that iraq puts the interests of its people first and is committed to creating an environment in which companies will want to invest. establishing that business-friendly environment requires respecting contract sanctity and providing necessary security guarantees,” added the official. iraq’s council of ministers on thursday approved a new financial agreement with the kurdistan regional government (krg), paving the way for the resumption of salary payments to the region’s public employees and the restart of kurdish oil exports, which have been suspended for more than two years. the iraqi government said the agreement stipulates that the krg is obliged to export all of the oil produced from its fields - estimated at 230,000 barrels per day - through iraq’s state oil marketing organization (somo). the krg will retain 50,000 barrels per day for local consumption, covering production costs, while the federal ministry of oil may provide refined oil products equivalent to 15,000 barrels per day if needed. erbil will also hand over non-oil revenues. in return, baghdad will pay the kurdish government’s share from the federal budget. the krg, which approved the deal with the federal government ahead of its announcement by baghdad, has not confirmed its contents. kurdish prime minister masrour barzani said he welcomed their “understanding” and expected baghdad to resume the disbursement of the salaries of his government’s civil servants who have only been paid for four months this year. with the announcement of their agreement, drone attacks on locations in the kurdistan region have stopped. in the month of july, there were at least 18 drone attacks. oil fields operated by international companies have been a primary target. the last incident occurred on thursday when two explosive-laden drones crashed in the outskirts of erbil, according to the erbil-based directorate general of counter terrorism (ctd). another drone attack was repelled on the same day in the shekhan district of duhok province, home to oil fields operated by international companies, a security source told rudaw at the time. the kurdistan regional government (krg) has blamed the attacks on iraq’s popular mobilization forces (pmf), a charge baghdad has denied. aziz ahmad, deputy chief of staff to prime minister barzani, said in a statement on wednesday that the region has lost nearly 200,000 barrels of oil production due to the “spate of drone attacks by criminal militias on the iraqi government payroll.” the attacks have been widely condemned, including by the un, us and uk. “demonstrating a commitment to safeguarding and supporting international investment is especially important in the current environment where drone attacks have targeted u.s. and other international companies’ operations in the iraqi kurdistan region without consequence,” the state department official noted in the email to rudaw."

2025-07-26 12:04:58+00:00,Energy,"volkswagen profits collapse amid us tariffs and electric-vehicle disappointment | carl deconinck, brussels signal germany’s auto giant volkswagen has reported a 36.3 per cent drop in its net profits, citing us tariffs and ongoing struggles with its electric vehicle strategy. with weak performance across its premium brands, the lower saxony automaker also abandoned earlier hopes of up to 5 per cent revenue growth, now anticipating sales to remain flat compared to last year. weak financial results from audi and porsche, two of volkswagen’s most profitable subsidiaries, also weighed heavily on group earnings. “increased us import tariffs and restructuring measures had a negative impact”, said chief financial officer arno antlitz. meanwhile, the shift to electric vehicles has dented volkswagen’s economic engine considerably. “the operating result declined by a third year-on-year – also due to higher sales of lower-margin all-electric models,” antlitz added. volkswagen’s second-quarter net profit fell to €2.29 billion, while its operating profit dropped by 29 per cent to €3.83 billion. its operating margin of 4.7 per cent was now the lowest in years. revenue declined by 3 per cent to €80.6 billion despite a slight uptick in deliveries. in response, volkswagen cut its full-year profit margin forecast to between 4.0 per cent and 5.0 per cent, down from its previous hopes of between 5.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent. the outcome of us–eu trade talks also weigh heavily on volkswagen’s future. potential tariffs range between 10 and 27.5 per cent depending on negotiations, and a blanket 30 per cent duty threatened by the us after august 1–currently less than a week away–could further impact forecasts. despite the headwinds, vw says it will continue to persist with its long-term transformation, including a shift toward electrification and a €15 billion cost-saving plan—though any near-term payoff remains elusive. volkswagen already has been hit by a 25 per cent tariff hike imposed by washington on imported vehicles, which came into effect earlier this year as part of a broader protectionist trade policy. the company estimated these increased duties have cost it around €1.3 billion in the first half of 2025 alone. to shield its american consumers from the full impact of the price increases, vw temporarily absorbed the additional costs, further squeezing margins. north american sales by volume fell 16 per cent over the same period, however, primarily due to these tariffs. the underperformance of the premium audi and porsche brands was especially damaging given their historic role in boosting profitability during industry downturns. while volkswagen’s shift to electric cars continues, sales of electric vehicles remain less profitable than their combustion-engine counterparts. margins in the electric vehicle segment are under pressure from high production and development costs, ongoing supply chain adjustments, and limited pricing flexibility. despite growing demand, evs deliver weaker returns and contributed to the company’s overall margin contraction. volkswagen cited a significant decline in earnings from china, one of its most important markets. the group is also incurring high restructuring costs as it overhauls its global operations. this includes a landmark agreement struck with unions last year to cut 35,000 jobs in germany by 2030, part of a cost-saving programme aimed at reducing annual expenses by €15 billion. these transformation efforts, critical for long-term competitiveness, are currently adding short-term financial strain. “the volkswagen group has held its own in an extremely challenging environment,” argued ceo oliver blume, citing “improved product design, quality, and software integration”. “in a challenging global market environment, our sales figures remain stable”, blume added. read more:"

2025-07-28 16:12:36+00:00,Energy,"china ditches u.s. lng as russian pipelines and domestic output surge: ""over the past couple of years, china has become the world’s largest importer of liquefied natural gas (lng), surpassing japan as the top buyer of super-chilled gas since 2021. china’s surging lng imports have been shaping asian energy flows, with the country accounting for more than 40% of the continent's total lng import growth. however, china’s dominance in lng markets now appears in jeopardy, and we are seeing a prolonged decline in imports. according to ship-tracking data by kpler via bloomberg, china’s lng imports are estimated to have clocked in at 5 million metric tons in june 2025, good for a hefty 12% year-on-year decline, marking the eighth straight month of declines. in the first four months of the year, china’s lng imports slumped to 20 million tons, a sharp fall from 29 million tons from last year’s comparable period. full-year imports for the current year are now expected to fall 6–11% to 76.65 million metric tons. this trend appears to defy earlier projections for china’s lng demand to continue growing through 2035. this, coupled with ongoing shifts in the country’s oil import dynamics, signals major changes in global energy flows. in 2023, china averaged 9.5 billion cubic feet per day in lng imports, with australia supplying 34% of total imports; qatar 23%, russia 11% and malaysia 10%. there are several factors driving this unexpected trend. first off, china has seen a significant increase in pipeline imports from russia and central asia, as well as a 6% increase in domestic gas production, both lowering lng demand. pipeline gas accounted for 41% of china’s 16.0 bcf/d natural gas imports in 2023, with russia (via the power of siberia 1 pipeline), turkmenistan and myanmar supplying the majority. russia is actively increasing its pipeline gas exports to china as part of its strategy to reorient its energy exports away from europe and towards asia, with china as the leading target. specifically, the power of siberia 1 pipeline is expected to reach its full capacity of 38 billion cubic meters (bcm) by 2025, and a new pipeline, power of siberia 2, is planned to further increase exports to china by an additional 50 bcm per year. russia is also exploring other potential pipeline routes to china, including one that would transit through kazakhstan. this could further expand export capacity and provide alternative routes to diversify supply. second, trade tensions between washington and beijing have forced china to halt u.s. lng imports since march 2025 after trump slapped a punitive 125% tariff on its key trading partner. consequently, china redirected purchases to asian suppliers like qatar and indonesia. third, weak industrial demand due to slowing growth by china’s industrial and chemical sectors has taken a toll on gas demand. these pivotal sectors are experiencing a slowdown due to a combination of factors including a broader economic slowdown, a struggling real estate market, weaker global demand for exports, and reduced foreign investments. to exacerbate matters, china's gdp growth is projected to slow down in the coming years despite showing resilience against u.s. tariffs, with forecasts suggesting growth below the official target and a further easing in 2026. the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) has projected that china’s economic growth will moderate from 5.0% in 2024 to 4.7% in 2025 and 4.3% in 2026. finally, a milder winter has lowered demand for residential heating particularly in northern china. china’s falling lng imports are having ripple effects across global energy markets. weakening demand is freeing up lng volumes, easing supply pressure to other asian countries including japan and india as well as europe. falling chinese demand is also depressing asian spot lng prices, with prices dropping to $11/mmbtu in may 2025 from a february peak of $16.50/mmbtu. chinese buyers tend to turn to pipeline gas and domestic production whenever asian gas prices exceed $10/mmbtu. finally, the halt of u.s. lng exports to china threatens long-term contracts worth 20 million tons per year with u.s. suppliers. chinese lng buyers are now reselling u.s. cargoes to europe and also seeking new deals with asia-pacific and middle eastern suppliers, undermining u.s. export growth."""

in 2024, we exported $4.9 billion worth of canola, including seed, oil, and meal, to china. this is a critically important market. and let’s not forget the serious impact on peas, pork, and other products china has targeted. it isn’t just canola. the real reason behind china’s move why is china doing this? oh, there’s some claimed “dumping” of canola into chinese markets and subsidies to canadian farmers from our government. but that is simply an excuse. canadian farmers are subsidized far less than many other countries, including most european countries and the united states. the real reason is because canada imposed a 100 percent tariff on chinese electric vehicles in october of 2024. this was supposedly done to protect canada’s auto industry. china is striking back to pressure the canadian government. ottawa’s choices matter the federal government made a choice last october and continues to make the same choice today: sacrifice western canada for eastern canada. the auto industry is a key source of votes in the east. the west is not. the canola industry is worth $43 to $45 billion, employing 200,000 people. it alone, without considering any of the other crops we grow out west, is significantly larger than steel, aluminum, and auto manufacturing combined. this doesn’t need to be a competition, though. every industry in canada is essential to its short and long-term prosperity. all we’re asking is to be treated equally —to be offered the same level of support and attention the auto industry gets when trade barriers arise. doesn’t the canadian government already support farmers? our federal and provincial governments cost share part of the cost of our crop insurance system. they also provide a revenue stabilization insurance product called agristability, which recently got a couple of needed improvements. obviously, crop insurance doesn’t protect farmers against commodity price collapse, as that is a yield protection product only. agristability does – but its support levels are so far below profitability that farmers are losing a lot of money before it kicks in. and that is a common misconception: agristability cannot help us in this situation, not really. what the loss of the chinese market does is remove our profit margin. agistability will not kick in to protect a profit, only reducing losses. this product cannot help us here. farmers are bearing the burden of government policy protecting one industry to spite another–one that’s orders of magnitude larger. we have spent the money on this crop. our investment is in. the fertilizer, herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides are applied. the fuel is burned, the machinery used. and now, on the brink of harvest, we just lost our profit margin on one of our most important crops. china knows exactly what it’s doing. they knew how to hit us where and when it hurts the most. but are they overestimating how interested our federal government is in doing something about it? this is far bigger than farmers this action by china isn’t just an attack on farmers—it’s an attack on all of canada. this affects everyone, all across this country. the policies our governments, federally and provincially, put in place have an enormous impact on our livelihoods. from investment in crop breeding and infrastructure, to developing and maintaining trade agreements and market access, to providing insurance backstops, government policy matters. something must change it’s time for our government to stop biting the hand that feeds it. it’s time to recognize the enormity of the canadian agriculture. the success of farmers across this country drives the prosperity of millions of canadians. yet, time and again, the government enacts policies that actively damage agriculture. from ill-conceived climate policy, to falling investment in critical agriculture canada breeding programs, to repeated diplomatic blunders that alienate key export markets. something must change. agriculture is one of canada’s largest industries, providing 8 percent of gdp and one in eight jobs. it could be one of canada’s crown jewels—a target for strategic investment and clear, consistent policy to ensure success for generations. government policy can, should, must be an asset to canadian farmers, not a burden. something must change. canadians, if there ever was a time to talk to your mp’s and tell them why agriculture matters, it’s now. share this: x facebook linkedin reddit email like this: related investment in agriculture: boosting canada’s future december 7, 2024 in ""advocacy"" don’t tell farmers how to farm – ask them instead april 16, 2022 in ""a farmer's views"" the war on agriculture is not over yet february 24, 2025 in ""advocacy"" posted in a farmer's views, advocacy published by jake i am a farmer from near weyburn, saskatchewan, canada. we grow durum, wheat, canola, peas, lentils, and flax. i farm with my family, including my wife and three young sons, along with several other family members. we are a 3rd-generation farm that strives to continually improve - to leave things better than we found them. i'm involved in various places in the agriculture industry as well to try and build a better future. as a farmer and an agronomist, agriculture, and the science and business therein, is my fascination and my passion."

""this is not true in itself. the basis of mol's success is a very strong infrastructure, a complex refining capacity and the fact that we can effectively exploit synergies."" he said that currently the gas station network is one of the engines of the group, although previously this sector was only considered a ""necessary evil""."

2025-08-25 20:02:38+00:00,Energy,"china’s tariffs on canadian peas in march 2025, china imposed retaliatory tariffs of 100% on imports of canadian peas (along with canola oil and meal), effective march 20, 2025. this was in response to broader trade tensions, including canada’s tariffs on chinese electric vehicles and other goods, amid escalating u.s.-initiated trade wars under the trump administration. the tariffs have severely disrupted canadian pea exports to china, a major market for pulses. prior to the tariffs, canada exported hundreds of thousands of tonnes of yellow peas to china annually (e.g., about 500,000 tonnes in 2024, valued at over cad 300 million). the duties have rendered these exports uncompetitive, causing a sharp drop in demand, oversupply in other markets, and downward pressure on prices. as of august 2025, the tariffs remain in place, with industry groups like pulse canada and alberta pulse growers highlighting the “devastating” impact on the sector. the canadian government has provided support for affected farmers, but resolution remains uncertain amid ongoing global trade frictions. current pea prices in western canada (as of august 25, 2025) the tariffs have exacerbated a bearish market for yellow peas in western canada (primarily saskatchewan and alberta, which account for over 90% of production), leading to significantly lower prices due to lost chinese access, increased domestic production (seeded area up ~9.5% to 1.42 million hectares for 2025-26), and softening global pulse demand from northern hemisphere harvests. this has resulted in oversupply and muted export opportunities to alternatives like india or europe. prices vary by variety, region, and delivery terms (e.g., farmgate vs. delivered to elevator), with yellow/feed peas bearing the brunt of the decline. recent reports confirm farmgate and spot bids in western canada have fallen to as low as cad 6.00 per bushel for yellow peas, reflecting the user’s observation of “but ow $6.00 a bushel” (interpreting this as “but now $6.00 a bushel” amid the tariff-induced slump). this is a notable drop from earlier 2025 levels (e.g., new crop bids were $1.50–2.00 higher in july) and the 2023-24 crop year average of ~cad 11.54–12.45 per bushel for 1can grade field peas. while some delivered bids remain higher, farmgate prices in saskatchewan and northern alberta are indeed at or below cad 6.00/bu in spot markets, signaling distress for producers. here’s an updated summary based on mid-to-late august 2025 data:"

2025-08-27 19:38:01+00:00,Energy,"u.s. tariffs of 50 percent took effect wednesday, aug. 27, on many indian products, doubling an existing duty as u.s. president donald trump sought to punish new delhi for buying russian oil. trump has stepped up pressure on india over the energy transactions, a key source of revenue for moscow, as part of a campaign to end the ukraine conflict. while trump has slapped fresh duties on allies and competitors alike since returning to the presidency in january, this 50-percent level is among the highest that u.s. trading partners face. however, exemptions remain for sectors that could be hit with separate levies, including pharmaceuticals and computer chips. the trump administration has launched investigations into these and other sectors that could culminate in further duties. smartphones are in the list of exempted products as well. industries that have already been singled out, such as steel, aluminum and automobiles, are similarly spared these countrywide levies. the united states was india's top export destination in 2024, with shipments worth $87.3 billion. but analysts have cautioned that a 50 percent duty is akin to a trade embargo and is likely to harm smaller firms. new delhi has criticized washington's move as ""unfair, unjustified and unreasonable."" the world's fifth-largest economy is looking to cushion the blow, with indian prime minister narendra modi promising to lower the tax burden on citizens during an annual speech to mark india's independence. modi earlier vowed self-reliance as well, pledging to defend his country's interests. russia accounted for nearly 36 percent of india's total crude oil imports in 2024. buying russian oil saved india billions of dollars on import costs, keeping domestic fuel prices relatively stable. indian oil, the country's biggest and state-owned refiner, has said it will continue to buy russian crude depending on the economics, company sources told reuters last week."

2025-08-29 16:44:00+00:00,Energy,"exposing tarrifs hypocrisy: facts vs. claim the attack on india over russian oil is a textbook case of double standards. while the trump administration imposes punitive 50% tariffs on indian goods and brands india a “money laundromat” for russia, the united states itself quietly sustains and even expands, its trade with moscow. america’s own dependency on russian commodities tells the real story: despite a 2024 law banning russian uranium, washington imported $596 million worth in the first five months of 2025 alone, a 28 percent year-on-year jump, under waivers that remain valid until 2028. fertilizer imports touched $806 million, up 21 percent, while palladium imports rose 37 percent to $502 million. all of these are exempted because they are considered “strategic necessities” for american industry and food security. the overall trade picture is just as striking. in 2024, us-russia bilateral trade amounted to $3.5 billion, with the us running a $2.4 billion trade deficit with moscow. between january and may 2025, american imports from russia rose another 23 percent, reaching $2.1 billion. meanwhile, europe’s exposure to russian energy dwarfs both the us and india. the eu imported $41 billion worth of russian goods in 2024, including record lng purchases of $8.5 billion. france alone accounted for 37 percent of europe’s russian lng intake. by contrast, india’s record reveals a steady diversification. the russian share of indian arms imports has fallen to 36 percent from 55 percent a decade ago, with france and the us steadily rising as suppliers. india also exported $84.2 billion worth of refined petroleum in 2024, much of it to europe, countries fully aware that these products were refined from russian crude. the hypocrisy is clear. the us defends its own russian uranium and fertilizer imports as unavoidable because there are “no alternatives,” yet it penalizes india for purchasing crude vital to its energy security. mr. navarro’s charge that india acts as an “oil money laundromat” ignores the fact that western economies remain far more dependent on russian commodities than india ever was. what emerges is not a matter of principle, but of selective trade politics; shielding own interests while punishing others."

the kurdistan region will supply its daily oil production to iraq. in return, baghdad is obliged to allocate one trillion iraqi dinars to the kurdistan region. clickbaiters told you over an over it's delay was for a new rate: total bs the delay was because baghdadi and kurdistan have have different models for contracts with international oil companies (iocs) 1. federal gov. is a service contracts model for iocs government hires (pays the money upfront) to iocs as contractors to explore, develop, and produce oil. iocs are paid a fixed fee plus a share of production for their services. 2. krg is a production sharing contracts model iocs act as partners, funding all exploration and development risks. they receive a share of the produced oil (after cost recovery) as profit, with the government taking the remainder. the fed gov. service contracts prioritize government control while krg pscs production sharing contracts model with no state outlay upfront and profit sharing. baghdad pivot toward psc-like elements (as in this deal) reflects necessity.its liquidity crunch makes the krg's model more viable, to read full article the recent agreement between the kurdistan regional government (krg) and baghdad on the resumption of oil exports has been hailed as a landmark achievement for the kurdistan region, with potential ripple effects across iraq’s energy policy, according to energy and oil contracts expert dilshad muwani, muwani emphasized that the deal represents not only an economic and political win for erbil but also a structural shift in how iraq manages its oil sector. key provisions of the agreement under the deal, the kurdistan region will supply its daily oil production to iraq. in return, baghdad is obliged to allocate one trillion iraqi dinars to the kurdistan region. muwani stressed that this arrangement strengthens the krg’s position: “the kurdistan region is the major winner in this agreement. iraq is effectively forced to provide budgetary support to the region in exchange for access to its oil production.” baghdad’s shift toward production sharing the agreement underscores iraq’s worsening cash crisis, which has constrained its ability to sustain traditional oil service contracts. under the service contract model, the iraqi government pays upfront for exploration and production costs and later compensates companies with a portion of the extracted oil. however, muwani noted that iraq no longer has the liquidity to maintain this system: “iraq does not have enough cash to invest in oil fields and drill new wells. it cannot pursue service contracts in which the government pays the cost of extraction and then rewards companies with oil.” by contrast, the kurdistan region has long relied on production sharing contracts (pscs), in which foreign companies cover exploration and drilling costs in exchange for a negotiated share of production. this model suited the krg in its early years, when it lacked robust oil infrastructure and sufficient investment capital. now, faced with a fiscal crunch, baghdad appears to be shifting closer to the kurdistan model. “due to its liquidity crisis, iraq is forced to resort to production-sharing mechanisms. this reduces the financial burden on the federal government and encourages foreign companies to invest without baghdad having to allocate large amounts of cash,” muwani explained. implications for iraq’s energy policy analysts argue that the agreement could mark a turning point for iraq’s broader oil strategy. the deal not only ensures a steady flow of revenue for the kurdistan region but also signals baghdad’s willingness to embrace new contractual models. muwani underlined the significance of this shift:“the agreement between the kurdistan region and baghdad is not only an economic and political achievement for erbil, but it will also reshape iraq’s oil policy. iraq’s move toward co-production contracts represents an important transformation that requires deeper research to assess its long-term impact.” the alignment of federal oil policy with the krg’s psc framework could also pave the way for greater stability in investor relations, potentially making iraq more attractive to international energy companies seeking predictable, profit-sharing arrangements. the resumption of oil exports from the kurdistan region represents more than a budgetary lifeline. it underscores baghdad’s growing reliance on the production-sharing model pioneered by the krg, driven by its own financial crisis. if managed wisely, this shift could stabilize iraq’s energy sector, attract foreign investment, and redefine federal-regional relations in the oil industry. still, the long-term implications—both political and economic—remain uncertain. as muwani concludes, the agreement “draws a new map for oil relations in iraq” and requires careful policy planning to maximize benefits for both baghdad and erbil while ensuring regional energy stability."

2025-09-20 19:14:27+00:00,Energy,"barzani signals breakthrough on oil exports: a turning point for iraq and kurdistan at the inauguration of the sheikhan–lalish road project in duhok, kurdistan region prime minister masrour barzani delivered a statement that could redefine iraq’s energy map. he confirmed that the federal government in baghdad and international oil companies (iocs) operating in the region have reached a broad understanding—one that may soon unlock the long-stalled resumption of kurdish oil exports. geopolitical context for 18 months, kurdish crude has been absent from international markets after exports through turkey’s ceyhan pipeline were suspended in march 2023. the freeze has drained more than \$30 billion from iraq and the kurdistan region, tightening fiscal space, reducing investment flows, and weakening confidence in the country’s oil sector. the new understanding marks a step toward reconciling iraq’s competing power centers: baghdad’s federal control and erbil’s autonomous energy policy. if implemented, it would not only restore vital revenues but also stabilize relations with ankara, which has been eager to see the pipeline reopened under a clear legal framework. banking and fiscal dimensions beyond oil, barzani underscored erbil’s cooperation with baghdad on budget and salary disputes, stressing that “no obstacles have ever been created” from kurdistan’s side. a july deal already set terms: erbil agreed to transfer 230,000 barrels per day to somo and remit 120 billion iraqi dinars in non-oil revenues, in return for federal salary disbursements. yet delays persist—civil servants only received june salaries in september, while july and august remain unpaid. such gaps undermine public trust and highlight the urgent need for more predictable federal transfers and financial discipline. currency and economic outlook should oil exports resume, iraq’s macroeconomic landscape could shift significantly. restoring over 400,000 barrels per day from the kurdistan region would inject billions in foreign exchange into iraq’s reserves, strengthen the central bank of iraq’s ability to defend the dinar, and relieve pressure on the parallel market. internationally, investors would interpret the breakthrough as a sign of political maturity and institutional coherence, potentially accelerating iraq’s bid for greater global financial integration, including wto accession and deeper ties with ifis. outlook barzani’s remarks signal more than a technical oil deal—they represent a potential reset of baghdad–erbil relations. if baghdad delivers on salary payments and iocs receive payment guarantees, the long-awaited flow of kurdish oil could resume within weeks. this would send a powerful message: iraq is ready to move past old disputes and harness its full energy potential for national stability and regional influence. for the kurdistan region, it would mean fiscal breathing room and renewed faith in partnership with baghdad. for iraq as a whole, it would mean reclaiming lost revenues, strengthening its currency base, and demonstrating to global markets that cooperation, not fragmentation, defines its future. melaniastasia romanov"

2025-09-30 17:28:05+00:00,Energy,china’s own shale gas revolution china has become the world’s largest gas importer following the government’s decision to convert urban heating systems from coal to reduce air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions. imports increased to a record 180 billion cubic metres (roughly 130 million tonnes) in 2024 up from zero less than two decades ago owing to the rapid growth in consumption. china relied on imports to satisfy more than 40% of its consumption last year having been self-sufficient as recently as 2005. dependence on imports would be a major vulnerability in the event of a future conflict with the united states and its allies. but increasing imports have obscured china’s phenomenal success boosting domestic production through a mix of planning targets and price incentives. .

2025-09-30 22:36:19+00:00,Energy,"1. venezuela’s oil wealth venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, even more than saudi arabia. oil makes up about 95% of venezuela’s exports and is the backbone of its economy. 2. u.s. sanctions & economic collapse in the 2010s, the u.s. imposed heavy sanctions on venezuela’s oil industry (especially on state oil company pdvsa). these sanctions were meant to pressure nicolás maduro’s government. the result: venezuela was cut off from the u.s. financial system, couldn’t sell oil freely, and its currency collapsed. this triggered hyperinflation, with basic goods costing millions of bolívars. 3. china steps in while the u.s. tried to choke venezuela economically, china and russia stepped in as lifelines. china has loan-for-oil deals with venezuela, meaning venezuela sends crude in exchange for chinese financing. in recent years, china buys much of venezuela’s sanctioned oil at a discount, rerouting it through middlemen or blending it to hide its origin. 4. why the u.s. wants it the u.s. still wants access to venezuelan oil because: it’s close geographically (cheap transport compared to middle east). it could help stabilize oil prices and reduce dependence on opec and hostile states. american refineries are built to process venezuela’s heavy crude. 5. the big picture venezuela’s crisis wasn’t just from “bad socialism” or “mismanagement” — u.s. sanctions crushed its ability to sell oil legally. china filled the gap, securing cheap energy while building political influence in latin america. now the u.s. is reconsidering its stance, since blocking venezuela only pushed it deeper into china’s orbit."
